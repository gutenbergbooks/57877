POSTAL AGITATION</h1>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</h2>

<div class="chapter">

<p>INTRODUCTORY—THE CAUSES OF DISCONTENT AND
THE RISE OF POSTAL AGITATION</p>

</div>

<p>The long continuance of agitation and disaffection in the
postal service would seem almost to entitle the public to the
belief that the Post-Office is a place where the Englishman’s
privilege, which is to grumble, is systematically maintained
and indulged in as a recreation. Possibly to many it might
seem to justify some such cynicism as that the Post-Office is
a public institution whose employés make mild conspiracy their
serious business in their working hours, and deliver letters and
send telegrams only as a pastime.</p>

<p>The spirit of unrest, at last finding expression in organised
agitation, has for so long been associated with the Post-Office
that that department has come to be regarded in the public
mind as not merely a vehicle of general convenience, but
principally as a hot-bed of discontent. In strange contrast
to that serene contentment and peaceableness which so distinguishes
the rest of the Civil Service, the Post-Office has
continued to stand out, with its familiar declaration of grievances,
a single discordant note in the harmony. The Temple
of Mercury in St Martin’s-le-Grand has been found from time
to time the scene of angry discord, and the caduceus of the
messenger of the gods, with its twining snakes, receives a
new significance as a postal emblem. The ground about, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
should be expected to yield nothing but the perennial golden
harvest, is found to be given over to weeds, and the production
of a crop of nettles.</p>

<p>Until recently almost, discontent in a Government department
was thought a form of moral disease, and agitators were
hunted as assiduously as was the Colorado beetle. There are
doubtless many among the public who actually entertain some
such view in regard to postal servants. There are many again
to whom the Post-Office is represented by the principal living
emblem in livery, the postman; and him perhaps a few tolerate
as something of a nuisance, to whom they have to give a forced
contribution annually to bring up his wages, or whom custom
compels them to bribe into civility and a proper observance
of his duties. For beyond the fact that discontent has prevailed
more or less in the postal service for many years past,
the public know but little of the inner workings or of the conditions
which produce this symptom. It may be that the
postman, being such a familiar, and to the majority a more or
less welcome figure, filling the public eye, as he does, shares
only with the Postmaster-General the distinction of representing
the greatest public working institution in the world.
What lies behind the outward and visible working of the vast
and complicated piece of machinery, neither the man in the
street nor his peers care much about, because it is hidden
away from the light of day. The numerous army of postal
workers, which comprise the indoor staff—those who sort letters
and those who send telegrams—are as little thought of as the
unseen crew of stokers below, engaged in their inglorious, but
none the less useful, task of keeping the furnaces agoing.</p>

<p>The history of labour in the Post-Office has been a history
of restraint and repression on one side, and of determined,
persistent, and, in the end, more or less successful resistance
on the other. The awakening of the trades-union spirit,
and the manifestation of discontent, so long as it confined
itself to a few London letter-carriers, was not formidable
enough to excite either the anxiety or the animosity of the
department. Discontent, disorganised, sporadic, and uncertain
in its utterance, could either remain ignored or dealt with
summarily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>It was only when agitation assumed much larger dimensions
that it began to arouse that mingled feeling of apprehension
and aversion which in itself became the means of aggravating
still further those very evils which the authorities aimed at
suppressing. Time and again the authorities, while complaining
of the heat, yet added fuel to the fire.</p>

<p>Unionism in the Post-Office has ever been regarded as
something verminous, something to be stamped out, something
impertinently out of place in a Government office, and its
leaders treated as breeders of sedition. And this has been so
many years after the principle of trades unionism has at last
been reconciled to Respectability and folded in her arms.</p>

<p>Slowly, step by step, labour in the Post-Office has gained
something of a recognition of its value; but it has been forced
to fight its way ofttimes with manacled hands and tape-tied
feet. Happily, however, the story of postal agitation and the
spread of combination throughout the postal service is not
made up entirely of failures, contumacies, inflictions, and
punishments. That combination in this branch of the public
service has had to fight hard for its very existence from the
beginning till now is perfectly true. It has been uphill work
throughout, and its wounded have been left by the way. But
in its struggle against the forces of bureaucracy it has snatched
a victory here and there; it has received rebuffs, and even
now and again courted defeat, but it has had its exultant
moments of victory too. And, on the whole, there is little to
regret that the fight so far has been fought; for where men
have a principle at stake perhaps, to paraphrase a great dead
poet, ’tis better to have fought and lost than never to have
fought at all.</p>

<p>That the department has given as little heed as possible to
the claims of postal servants, and far less sympathy, goes
without saying. It has to be remembered that it is a public
department, and, generally speaking, in a public department
its niggardliness is in inverse ratio to its power of profit producing.
It requires no argument to prove that a public
institution such as this, run on the old conventional lines of
red-tape and routine, and for the most part in the leading-strings
of a watchful Treasury, would never spontaneously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
better the condition of its servants. If the same holds good
generally as regards the relations between capital and labour,
between the private employer and his man, it is more particularly
so in a public department. Experience has proved that
a betterment of the conditions of labour among the working
staffs of public bodies as a rule have had to be forced from
the authorities by every legitimate method which agitation
can devise, by persistent petitioning, by deputation, by public
meeting, often by taking the war into the enemy’s country,
and getting M.P.’s to beard the Postmaster-General and the
Treasury heads in their official lair, or by tracking them down
in the House of Commons. And even then, after all this expenditure
of force, there is often nothing but disappointment
in return.</p>

<p>That it is not always the administrators of a public department
who are to blame so much as the rule and the method
which usage and convention have fossilised, must in all fairmindedness
be allowed. It is easy to believe and understand
that the various heads of departments, though never
guilty of the unpardonable indiscretion of showing the smallest
sympathy for agitation as such, none the less do often deplore
the necessity of enforcing certain rules and regulations which
act to the detriment of the men or which are productive of
individual cases of hardship.</p>

<p>This point has only been touched on to show that the
grievances which have given rise to agitation in various times
have not been so much due to the action of officials as to the
rules which they have had to administer. Hemmed in by
such conditions, and bound to follow the customs prescribed
by tradition and laid down by departmental etiquette, the
natural inclination is to hold the reins tightly, to sit close,
never to give way for fear of appearing weak, and never to
willingly grant a concession merely because their private conscience
may tell them there is some reason and justice in the
demand. In such a situation the responsible public official
has to face a higher tribunal than his own conscience. It is
always fairly safe to refuse concession, but it is dangerous to
grant it until you are compelled to. When the public, the
press, and Parliament unite in saying such and such a demand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
must and shall be conceded, then it is time to act, not before.
You bow with a good grace, and salaam and say, “Am I not
my master’s servant?” And the public and the press and
Parliament think none the less of you for your firmness, interpreting
your stubbornness as zeal for the public service, though
they would have turned to rend you for your incompetence
had you given way sooner. Such to some extent is the trying
position of those in authority in public departments, they needs
must only when the devil drives, and not a moment before.
They are more or less in the position of a constable whose
duty it is to keep back a clamorous crowd testing a right of
way; zeal and duty and anxiety for his position keep him
firmly at his post till his superior and the law give him the nod
and he has to fall back.</p>

<p>It is therefore perhaps not surprising that Government
officials have steadfastly pursued a policy of resistance to all
claims for reform emanating from the subordinate staff. And
this policy has been rendered the easier by such resistance
being shown through that abstract entity known as the
“Department,” which may mean one man or twenty, removing
as it does the necessity for any particular individual,
from the Secretary downward, to show his hand or reveal his
identity. This is the system which made possible Dickens’s
famous piece of satire anent the “Circumlocution Office.” It
also provides a justification for Sydney Smith’s equally famous
dictum regarding corporations, and, of course, Government
departments—that they “have neither a body to be kicked
nor a soul to be damned.”</p>

<p>Certainly, it holds generally true as an important and significant
fact of postal history, at any rate, that the authorities
have never allowed a claim except grudgingly. And a due
appreciation of this fact will conduce to a better understanding
of the events which follow.</p>

<p>That this species of official obstinacy is not altogether
peculiar to the postal service may be abundantly proved by
reference to the records of other public departments. The
postal authorities have sinned in very good company; and, to
be fair to both sides of the question, let it be said that on the
whole the sins of omission and commission have doubtless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
been dictated as much by a virtuous desire to save the public
funds as to enhance their own credit. That at least is a
saving virtue which is always conveniently placed to the credit
of every permanent and public official, even when he has
carried his zeal to excess. Allowing such a defence to stand
without cavilling or questioning, still the fact remains that in
their zeal for the public service the rights, the privileges, the
convenience, the creature comforts, the health, and, it might
be said, the very lives of many of the staff under their control
have often been sacrificed in the past. Yet there have been
exceptions, and it will be seen that the tens of thousands
comprising the rank and file of the lower grades of the service
have some reason to hold in grateful esteem the memory of
one Postmaster-General at least—Professor Henry Fawcett.
The high-souled qualities of Henry Fawcett, the blind Postmaster-General,
are even now as familiar as is the recollection
of that lamentable infirmity which only roused him to “wrest
victory from misfortune.”</p>

<p>Generally, however, there have been two opposing principles
at work throughout. And with two such positive and negative
principles—the desire of the postal workers to assert those
rights already accorded to almost every other class of labour,
and the determination of the officials that such aspirations
must be suppressed as dangerous—it was only to be looked
for that open discontent would manifest itself sooner or later,
and presently assume a more or less definite shape.</p>

<p>The faults and shortcomings almost necessarily incident
to such a system of administration as has been indicated, its
failure to move with the requirements of the times, its too conservative
hesitation to compromise with the growing spirit of
reform, its refusal to make allowance for the universal tendency
to combine manifested among all classes of labour
outside, its cheese-paring economy carried into the question of
pay and prospects, were enough in themselves to beget a feeling
of unrest and uncertainty culminating in one of open
discontent and agitation. But these were only the first
elements contributing to combination and defence of principle.
Then it was that stubborn refusal to give way on the
part of the authorities developed into scarcely-disguised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
hostility to the men and their claims. They held the citadel
of privilege, and the waves of reform might beat against the
granite walls of St. Martin’s-le-Grand but they would make no
impression. Certainly they were not to be moved from their
position by the mutterings of a few hundred malcontents
inside who had become infected with the absurd ambition to
better their working conditions, and who actually aspired to
the wages of a skilled mechanic. Not while they had the
power and the license to construe respectful petitions into
impertinent demands and respectful remonstrances into insubordination
and constructive treason. It would have been too
much to have met such demands in a spirit of conciliation
and compromise, and, so early in the day, would have been
going against every workable tradition of departmentalism.
The fact that a Government situation was a guarantee of
permanent employment so long as they did not complain
should, it was thought, in itself be sufficient to induce the
men to accept every humiliation the department chose to put
on them. In its desire to govern according to its conception
of a benevolent despotism it too commonly provided
its employés with a grievance, or a succession of grievances,
arising from its attempt to shape their workaday lives by
rules of military discipline and restrictive regulations better
fitted for a penal settlement than for free men and citizens of
selected character and intelligence.</p>

<p>Such was the attitude of the department and the general
conditions of the postal service when the earlier would-be
reformers essayed to urge their plaint, and, in the most
legitimate manner, to strike a blow for freedom. The men
who have been alluded to as those who were first to engage in
agitation and the first to incur the as yet unknown danger of
arousing the resentment of officialdom against such daring
innovations, it must be acknowledged, made up in moral fibre
what they lacked in experience and methods of organisation.
At any rate, they deserve to be remembered kindly
by those who afterwards benefited by their efforts. They
were the first to cut away the undergrowth, and to make the
straight and solid path possible. If fault be found with their
methods, it has only to be said that their mistakes were such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
as generally come in the experimental stage of almost every
enterprise.</p>

<p>If it be thought that the happenings and incidents with
which they were connected or of which they were the authors
are here invested with undue importance, it will be recollected
that the men who were identified with those happenings were
among the first actors in an interesting little industrial drama.
It will perhaps not be lost sight of that the incidents themselves,
though insignificant if taken singly, none the less are
important links in the chain, and necessary parts of a whole.
Some acknowledgment is due to these men if only that they
were the humble pioneers of an industrial movement of a
special character. Not only this, but because they kept
abreast of the tide of progress when it was nothing less than
dangerous to do so.</p>

<p>If it be objected that every grievance complained of—the
conditions of service, insufficiency of pay prospects and promotion,
deprivation of civil liberty and the right of combination
reduced to a meaningless farce—have had and still have
their counterparts in every other department of the State, that
objection in itself scarcely lessens the justification for the
action taken by the agitators. The reasonableness or otherwise
of their methods is another matter which it is proposed to
deal with later on as this narrative unfolds itself. If it be
urged that the policy of attempting to force concessions from
a Government department has been a more or less selfish and
sordid one, it must be conceded also that principle has always
entered largely into it. That their sole consideration was not
getting the greatest material benefit at little cost, and that it
was not with them entirely a question of more bread and
butter and less work, is pretty well proved by the risks which
postal agitators have run and the sacrifices they have cheerfully
made. It has never been an easy matter for a man to demand
his just dues in a Government office. The attitude of mind
towards the subordinate staffs in the Post-Office has not essentially
altered since the days when they publicly hanged men
for letter-stealing. That was only a little more than sixty
years ago, and if the asperities of administration have been
somewhat softened of late years, it is only through the force<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
of public opinion, and because the men have learnt lessons
of appeal which render it almost impossible for officialdom to
persist in methods of repression for any length of time. It is
because the liberty of the working-classes has been so enlarged
that they can no longer withhold a modicum of it from postal
servants. But there is not wanting the evidence to show that
something of the same spirit which, in the olden times, sent
working-men to the hulks and penal servitude for attempting
to band themselves and their mates together for the purpose
of safeguarding their few interests from a greedy and rapacious
employer was alive still until quite recently, even if it has altogether
died out to-day. The postal servant seeking to better
his position or daring to complain still labours under far greater
disadvantages than the mechanic or the handicraftsman. A
postman, a sorting-clerk, or a letter-sorter, if he be dismissed
from his employment cannot pick up his bag of tools and offer
himself to the next workshop, for the simple reason that he
has no tools, and his trade is one of such a peculiar nature
that it is wanted nowhere outside the Post-Office. Nor is a
telegraphist much better off in that respect. Dismissal from
the service has generally meant very much more to the postal
official than to the ordinary artisan. He not only lost his
immediate source of livelihood but his future prospects, his
hopes of a pension, towards which he had contributed, his
character and everything were gone, and he had to face the
world afresh and take his stand in the battle of life against
those with every advantage over him. And dismissal was
particularly easy in the earlier times, when a suspicious and
malignant officialdom could construe the smallest sign of disaffection
into insubordination. Thus it will be seen it was no
child’s play to engage in agitation twenty or thirty years ago,
and the men who did so evidently did not enter into it for the
love of the game altogether. There must have been something
very rotten in the State of Denmark when men were goaded
into what was to them desperate methods, and with so many
odds against them, just for the sake of improving the conditions
of their servitude. It shows that they must have felt
their grievances keenly; it shows that in some degree at least
that spirit of resistance to wrong and injustice to which we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
owe so much animated and sustained them throughout. In
those days postal agitators stood almost alone, receiving very
little sympathy from the press or the public, and equally as
little assistance from the various trades unions, simply because
postal grievances, which have always been difficult of understanding,
were much more so then, and because it was difficult
then to make people believe that men in permanent Government
employment could have grievances of any kind. That
the trades unionists of the country were slow to rally to their
assistance or to proffer them practical sympathy is better now
understood and made allowance for, for postmen and letter-sorters
were not readily recognised as a separate craft by the
various unions of ordinary artisans; they could claim no trade
kinship with them; they were neither this nor that, but a sort
of ugly duckling in the legitimate brood of artisanship.</p>

<p>Fortunately a more intelligent understanding and a better
feeling now exist, and has existed for some years past. But
even to gain this simple recognition that a postal official with
a grievance battling against wrong was a man and a brother
entitled to admittance into their ranks, was not easily obtained
even when they sought it. Even the men themselves were
chary of accepting the position of professed trades unionists,
and it was many years before the objections associated with
declared trades union principles and methods were waived
by the men of the Post-Office. The fact is they remained for
long uncertain as to their exact relationship to the general
industrial and labour movement. There was some amount
of mutual distrust between outside trade organisations and
combination in the Post-Office, and both parties failed to see
distinctly what there was in common between them. It must
be admitted that despite their awakening so far, the postal
agitators still preserved something of that reserve which may
have been easily mistaken for pride or perhaps priggishness;
and, indeed, felt that an open connection with trades
unionism might damage their chances of redress, and alienate
the support and sympathy of the few public men on whom
they relied. Besides, it has to be considered that the trades-union
doctrine was not sufficiently accepted to be yet
accounted respectable. But all that is now past; it has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
rendered both respectable and respected by almost universal
acceptance, and postal agitation owes not a little to it. And
if postal agitation owes more to the spirit of trades unionism
than the latter does to any postal effort, then, to claim no
more for it, perhaps trades unionism has no reason to feel
ashamed of its poor relation who fought a battle in its behalf
years ago. They maintained its principle within that most
unlikely and unpromising of places, a Government office,
against hostile officials who were backed up with inexhaustible
reserves and the best artillery.</p>

<p>That the solid advantages gained through agitation have
not even up to the present day fully compensated for the
sacrifices made, the time, the trouble, the energy, and the
money expended on it, can perhaps be freely admitted. Yet
the same holds good of every other movement of higher
pretension, social and political. Men with a purpose count
the moral advantage as well as the material gain. If only
considerations of this nature had always weighed in the
past, our Merrie England would to-day be divided into slaves
and slave-owners.</p>

<p>To its credit be it said then, that postal agitation has not
been altogether confined to capturing the enemies’ cattle, or
to striving for yet a bigger share of the loaves and fishes. It
has only had to discover its duties and responsibilities to immediately
lay claim to them, and to strenuously assert its right
to fulfil them. It has always maintained the principle of combination
as a principle, while it has long and persistently
protested against the exclusion of postal servants from the
full enjoyment of civil rights and the untrammelled exercise
of the franchise. It has lost few opportunities of championing
the cause of the weak against departmental intolerance, and
silently and unseen it has often stayed the hand of official
persecution at the very moment it was raised to strike. It
has triumphed ultimately where often it has seemed to have
failed. It has fought for and won the one right accorded to
every free-born British citizen who was not a postal official—the
right of free speech and open public meeting.</p>

<p>When, as an unpretentious little organisation, numerically
weak and modest in its programme, it was first started by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
a few London postmen and letter-sorters, it was doubtless
prompted principally by the very human desire to improve
their own workaday lives and to benefit their wives and
children. It need not be claimed that they were animated by
any higher or nobler motive.</p>

<p>But as time went on, “new occasions taught new duties,”
and as the sphere of their operations almost insensibly
widened, so they readily accepted the responsibilities attaching
to their character as the wing of a forward movement.</p>

<p>BEGINNINGS OF COMBINED AGITATION—THE COMPULSORY
SUNDAY LABOUR QUESTION—FIRST PUBLIC PROTEST AT
EXETER HALL.</p>

</div>

<p>That the spirit of discontent in the Post-Office manifested
itself so far back as over half a century ago, will probably
somewhat surprise most people outside the postal service itself.
Possibly even farther back than that, some traces of discontent
and effort at agitation might be found; but in those obscure
days, however the working conditions of the service may
have justified it, all such effort must have begun and
ended with a few individual insubordinates, whose
names are buried in oblivion and the official records.
But it has to be remembered that in the earlier days
of the Post-Office the very conditions under which the members
of the working staff were introduced into the service
almost precluded the possibility of organisation for the redress
of grievances. Indeed, it may be well understood that in the
pastoral days of the good old times—when life went slower,
and when there was an absence of that feverish rush and hurry
so characteristic of the present everywhere, and of the Post-Office
in particular—postal officials were the happy inhabitants
of a sort of Sleepy Hollow. In a word, probably there was
little discontent in the earlier days, owing to the system of
appointment by patronage. At least, there could have been
very little open and avowed discontent, and much less could
it have been organised.</p>

<p>As a survival of the system in vogue in the old twopenny-post
days, the greater part of the working staff—that is to say,
those subordinates who afterwards came to be described as the
manipulative part of the machinery, were for many years after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
the introduction of the penny post recruited from those in
whose behalf some influence had been exercised or invoked.
Many were the sons of old servants of the aristocracy, others
the sons or relatives of the dependants of M.P.’s, of Justices
of the Peace, of lawyers, and public men more or less eminent.
Every notability who could exercise any influence with the
postal authorities, or with those who were <i lang="fr">en rapport</i> with the
powers that were, had their nominees. It was then next to
impossible for a mere outsider, whatever his merits, to obtain
employment under the Postmaster-General without this golden
talisman. This system, so general in the earlier days, has been
adverted to only in order to show one reason for there being so
little discontent openly manifested, and to explain why agitation
did not assume an organised form till later in the century.
For however slow may have been the times, doubtless the
conditions of the postal service were not even then so Arcadian
as to stifle entirely the feeling of discontent in some.
But the system of nomination by influence and patronage, and
what in these days might be called by the uglier name of
nepotism, was better calculated to foster a feeling of dependence
in the majority, and one of grateful loyalty in many.
This, too, it has been already pointed out, was in the days
when the principles of trades unionism were little studied and
little understood, even so far as they had taken root in the
minds of the working-classes. Combination in any shape or
form was in fact little sympathised with by those whom it
sought to benefit, and in Government offices particularly would
have been anathema to the authorities, or, at any rate, received
with fear and aversion.</p>

<p>While the good old principle of “looking after Doub” prevailed
extensively in every other Government office, it was
almost paramount in the Post-Office; and this being so, it
would be surprising to find anything but a state of stagnant
contentment existing among the working staff. If not exactly a
state of stagnant contentment, the readiness to assert a principle,
and to resent encroachment on existing rights and privileges,
would certainly not be forcibly in evidence. Whatever official
wrongs, if any, they may have been subjected to at the hands
of their superiors, they showed no willingness to be awakened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
to a sense of them. The tide of Chartism beat in vain against
the grim walls of the Post-Office; the fluctuations of trade
disputes, strikes, and lock-outs interested them only in a casual
way, if at all; while the bare idea of organised opposition to
the wishes of the authorities, however arbitrary, would have
spelt downright treason. They were recruited from a class of
men who, if they had not always been brought up in the paths
of virtue, had always gone along the line of least resistance,
which was that of conventional respectability. Once in the
Post-Office, they had a character to keep up, and they were
not as other men who had to work for their living with dirty
hands. They felt that their Queen and country had reposed
a confidence in them by selecting them for the responsible
position they held. They were something midway between
lawyers’ clerks and menials of the royal household. They
doubtless felt they were very superior persons, though their
wages were meagre and their uniform scanty; but the authorities
were like unto little gods to them, and so they took it for
granted that Heaven had established a natural gulf between
them. Still they were the children of patronage, and of fathers
whose only ambition was to see their sons settled in a Government
situation; for a Government situation was for their sons the
Mecca and the goal of those people who always kept good and
paid proper respects to the parson and their rent regularly to
the squire. And when the sons got there they felt they were
a chosen few, invested with a caste and a distinction which
entitled them to hold their heads a little higher than the
people living in the same street. The consciousness that
his neighbours occasionally pointed him out as the “gentleman
who works in the Post-Office” more than atoned for his
inability to wear fashionable clothes and a top-hat like his
superiors.</p>

<p>This system of patronage as a means of rewarding the deserving
relatives of old servitors and sworn retainers by drafting
them into the General Post-Office, though it would not be tolerated
in these democratic times, yet is reminiscent somewhat
of the good old days when such things were only right and
proper in every department of the State, and when it was taken
for granted that Government situations were only the just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
reward of faithful service rendered elsewhere to the heaven-born
men of power and influence in the State, and created for
them to prove their generosity. Such a system is perhaps
therefore saved from utter condemnation by just a suggestion
of poetry about it, recalling the earlier coaching days, when
the bond between master and servant was often one of intimacy
and mutual obligation; and perhaps it would not be difficult
to say a good word for it. It showed at least that whatever
the failings of those in power and those in high places, whatever
their attitude towards the working-classes generally, however
they may have sniffed contemptuously at any suggestion
of Chartism, or at all attempts at combination among the
masses, they were not always unmindful of their moral duties
towards their own dependants. Willingly enough they paid
their obligations, and rewarded services rendered by quickly
pushing the applicants into the service of the State. They
felt that they had discharged the whole duty of man when
they had done this; they had provided the son of a deserving
old family servant, of an influential constituent, or of a good
paying tenant, with a berth for life in a Government office,
and, what was more, had proved their importance in being
able to do so.</p>

<p>Still, whatever may have been the abuses attaching to such
a system, the State was to an extent the gainer in getting men
of good character, with a good certificate of family respectability,
and, moreover, men who were guaranteed to go for any
length of time without winding up, who were warranted never
to become discontented, but always to remain faithful and
loyal, well satisfied with the position in which it had pleased
God and their patron to place them.</p>

<p>With the rank and file of the postal service composed of
such men, brought in under such conditions, it is not surprising
that discontent never raised its head, and that many a
grievance went unredressed because it was silently endured.
Nor is it surprising that the Post-Office, garrisoned by such an
army sworn in in this manner, was almost the last citadel that
it attacked with any degree of success. It would have been
too dangerous for any man to have attempted to bell the cat
in those days, and however strong may have been the desire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
in some, without the support and confidence of their fellows
it would have been sheer official suicide to have taken the
first step. They were men calculated to endure much. Petty
official tyranny to such men meant no more than mild discipline.
A grievance with them was but an evanescent thing,
felt to-day, forgotten to-morrow; for they had a stake in the
Post-Office. To express discontent would be to court certain
dismissal, and that would have meant much to them, while it
would mean the betrayal of the good, kind patron, their
father’s master or landlord, whose powerful influence had
placed them there. Indeed, it is easy to understand that no
man would have felt himself either a spy or a renegade to
principle in secretly or openly denouncing the rash fool who
would endeavour to organise a meeting of protest against his
superiors. Such were the conditions and such the temper of
the men of the postal staff that must have long obtained prior
to the fifties and sixties. From the introduction of the penny
post in 1840, which practically organised the Post-Office on
a new basis, there is no evidence of combined discontent
worth recording till the early fifties, though through that period
of eighteen years or so the leaven of discontent was slowly but
surely working, till a desire to make their wants known at last
became manifest.</p>

<p>Yet only a few years after the institution of the penny post
the indoor working staffs and the letter-carriers were both
given grave cause for dissatisfaction by the extension of Sunday
labour. Whatever protest they may have made of their
own accord counted for little; but it is interesting to find
that so early as 1848 an influential and public-spirited section
of the community took up the matter of compulsory Sunday
labour on behalf of the aggrieved postal servants, the sorting-clerks
and others, and publicly expressed that dissatisfaction
which Government servants dared not themselves utter too
openly.</p>

<p>At that time it was contemplated by the authorities to
compel two attendances on that day as on other days of the
week, and to abolish entirely for postal servants in London the
distinction between the day of rest and ordinary working days.
This was the origin of that question of compulsory Sunday labour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
in the Post-Office, which was to continue for thirty years and
more as one of the prevailing causes of dissatisfaction to thousands
of men. On the 8th October 1849 a great mass meeting
was called at Exeter Hall to protest as strongly as possible
against this desecration of Sunday. The meeting was convened
in the interests of postal servants themselves as much
as in furtherance of the Sabbatarian principle, and there is
little doubt that the men of the Post-Office who were the principal
objectors to the new regulation, were behind the scenes
aiding and abetting in the success of the movement. A
writer in the <cite>Patriot</cite> newspaper of that year, and one evidently
familiar with the Post-Office machinery, drew a vivid picture
of the possibilities of Sunday labour in the Post-Office. This
article in the <cite>Patriot</cite>, probably from the pen of the first avowed
discontented postal servant, did not a little to further the memorial
for the cessation of the practice, which was afterwards
drawn up by the Sunday-School Union, and forwarded to the
Lords of the Treasury. The action of the authorities was
denounced as sacrilegious, arbitrary, and tyrannical, by a number
of clergymen and others speaking for the aggrieved men,
while Rowland Hill, the postal reformer, the “Father of the
Penny Post,” came in for a large share of hostile criticism, his
name being repeatedly hissed at the Exeter Hall meeting. If
the audience hissed Rowland Hill, they as loudly cheered the
postal servants on whom this new official imposition was to
be put, directly it became known that, to their honour, they
had respectfully but firmly declined to submit, and that when
the sheets for their signature went round the large establishment
only two men could be got to sign away their birthright
for the little extra pay. The name of the Queen was
invoked to prevent this iniquitous violation of the “Pearl
of Days.”</p>

<p>The memorial was forwarded to the Treasury; and the
request for an interview with Lord John Russell to support
the prayer of his memorial, met with only a curt refusal
through his secretary. There the matter ended, so far. The
Post-Office had its way, and compulsory Sunday labour in the
Post-Office became an established, and in the minds of many,
a disgraceful fact; to prove, however, a source of further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
trouble later on, and to provide one of the most substantial
excuses for agitation during the next thirty years. Yet the
comparatively feeble agitation by proxy, set on foot then in
1848, did produce, nevertheless, some little result; and on
March 18, 1850, a Parliamentary paper was issued to show
the “results of the measures recently adopted for the reduction
of Sunday labour in the Post-Office.”</p>

<p>ECONOMICAL REFORM AND A LOWERING OF STATUS—AN
ESTIMATE OF ROWLAND HILL—EFFORTS OF THE <cite>CIVIL
SERVICE GAZETTE</cite>—THE CONDITIONS OF THE SERVICE,
1854-60.</p>

</div>

<p>From about 1854 it seems a new class of men were gradually
being introduced. By the operation of what was known as
the Elcho Scheme, there was a large reduction of the clerical
class who had hitherto usually discharged the duties of letter-sorting,
as well as the despatch and receipt of mails. But the
authorities, beginning to awaken to the fact that the Post-Office
was becoming a splendid source of revenue, therefore
decided to cut down expenditure by introducing a more poorly
paid class to take up the duties of those who had been in
receipt of a much higher salary than it was proposed to offer
the new entrants.</p>

<p>The work of sorting letters, for example, which had hitherto
been performed by clerks, was now to be entrusted to men of
an inferior grade. And the “Report upon the Post-Office for
the year 1854,” in which this innovation is first announced,
expresses the hope that such persons on an inferior salary
would be able, as necessity arose, or on “occasions of any
extraordinary pressure,” to take a share also in the duties of
the clerks. This is perhaps one of the earliest indications
of that policy of cheese-paring and depreciation of the value
of official work, which, if it has not always justified discontent
and agitation, has proved a fruitful source of it. From the
introduction of the penny post, and probably from a long
time before, the public correspondence was treated tenderly
and disposed of conscientiously. So high was the importance
attached to it that none were deemed worthy of being entrusted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
with it who were not servants belonging to the “major
establishment.” Both the sorters of letters and those who
despatched the mails belonged to the clerical staff, while only
the work of “facing,” stamping, tying, and the work of conveyance
and porterage was entrusted to the class of minor
officials, who afterwards came to constitute the main bulk of
the force.</p>

<p>From this period the clerks, who had been the only ones
entrusted with the high responsibility of sorting and despatching
letters, gradually became a restricted and exclusive class,
while the lesser officials, who formerly had been scarcely
allowed to touch the correspondence, were now trained to
those superior duties, but without a corresponding increase of
remuneration. It is worthy, however, of bearing in mind that
the despatching of mails was still deemed of such a responsibility
and importance that mere letter-sorters were not yet
allowed to perform such duties, clerks only on a salary rising
to £400 a year being thought worthy of that honour, although
a few years later, when such duties became several times
heavier and correspondingly more responsible, the inferior
class of letter-sorters were compelled to take them up. It was
the continuance of this anomaly for some length of time,
indeed, which constituted one of the main elements of discontent,
and came to be regarded as a distinct grievance among
the letter-sorting staff especially.</p>

<p>As the growth of the Post-Office business necessitated a
larger staff to cope with it, so a new class of men were being
slowly introduced. The penny post was a reform so much
appreciated by the public by this time that it had become even
now, in 1854, the most flourishing business in the world.
And Rowland Hill was not slow to take every advantage of
his discovery that the Post-Office contained greater possibilities
than to remain a cheap public convenience. The
founder of the penny post was now Permanent Secretary,
and a greater power in the land than the Postmaster-General,
not a little of a bureaucrat, and one who had trained himself
to regard his postal domain as a sort of family preserve. He
saw no harm in introducing cheap labour; he discovered a
new way of cutting down expenses by relegating the work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
which had been paid for at a salary of from £200 to £400
a year to this new class of minor officials, mostly salaried at
less than a fourth that amount. There was one new element
introduced with the new-comers, however, which probably was
never taken into account at the time; and that was, that they
were drawn from a better educated, and a more enlightened
body of men than those hitherto engaged on inferior duties.
The educational tests for admission into the Post-Office had
previously been very meagre, and almost nil where special influence
had been used. The old system of patronage and
nomination was maintained as long as it was convenient, and
as long as it worked satisfactorily, and for some considerable
time longer. But at length, owing to the expansion of postal
business, even patronage could not of itself keep up an adequate
supply of qualified recruits. And it was impossible to go
begging to lords or distinguished commoners for poor relations,
or cast-off dependants, as that might be putting a premium on
dishonesty, and cheapening still further good recommendations
which were already in some cases too cheap to be genuine.
Besides, the growth of democratic ideas among people outside
was making them inquisitive. There was the beginning
of a feeling that nomination by aristocratic influence was not
of itself recommendation enough for a government post, however
humble; though, perhaps, this was shared most largely
among those ever ready to make a mark of public departments,
and by those who had failed themselves to invoke such influence,
or who envied those who had succeeded. Again,
the claims of education had never been sufficiently recognised
in filling these subordinate positions, and now was the opportunity
to get a better value for money. Accordingly by slow
degrees the old system of nomination by influence alone
became more honoured in the breach than in the observance.
At least it came to be not insisted on as the highest qualification—which
was certainly a step in the right direction.
Instead, a suitable educational test, coupled with ordinary
certificates as to character, was the principal introduction
required.</p>

<p>Patronage was still allowed to exercise its influence where
it desired, and continued to do so for many years afterwards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
but it was no longer held to be the only “open, sesame” to
a berth in the Post-Office. And so there were drawn from
almost every rank in life, men of a better educational standard;
men who knew the world better, and men who in many
instances fostered a feeling of independence, more or less, by
having some knowledge of a trade, or the experiences gained
in a former occupation. In any case they were not drawn
from any particular class. They were not all the sons or
relatives of sworn retainers—of humble and obedient family
servants grown grey in bowing and scraping to superiors—nor
from a stock always warranted by such circumstance to remain
quiet in harness. Doubtless some still were; but the
majority were not. If, on entering the Post-Office, they had
to share the lot of all postal officials in those days of being
deprived of the franchise, they were as free as, or freer than,
their predecessors, to influence members of Parliament secretly
and indirectly through their relatives or friends who had
votes to give, or may-be to sell. Though there is no reason
to think that any number of them at that time attached any
very serious importance to the loss of civil liberty in this respect
which entry into the public service entailed; still, members
of Parliament, and intending Parliamentary candidates having
influence in high quarters, could not altogether refuse their
good offices on behalf of a letter-carrier, or a sorter, whose
case, or whose individual claims, might be represented by a
friend who was a constituent suffering no such electoral disability.
One postal employé might influence half-a-dozen
votes in a constituency.</p>

<p>At first this new departure in economy had been attempted
very gingerly, only about twenty selected men of the minor
establishment being introduced into the sorting department
for this purpose. The class from which they were drawn
comprised the letter-carriers, messengers, doorkeepers, &amp;c.,
who were originally intended to remain in those inferior positions
as long as their service lasted. These twenty men were
accordingly brought into the Inland Letter Branch, where for
a time they were exclusively employed in the first stages of
those duties for which their superiors, the clerks, had been
drawing three times the highest salary they could ever hope to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
obtain. This work of primary sortation, dividing and subdividing
the correspondence at the general sorting and divisional
tables, necessitated no great intellectual strain, and
required no educational ability beyond that of reading the
addresses on the envelopes. But, as will be seen, the “experiment”
was bad in principle, inasmuch as whatever the
inducements, whatever the promises, the new sorting staff got
no improvement in pay or prospects. It was a too flagrant
and sudden depreciation of the standard of work hitherto
regarded as of such exclusive importance that none but clerks
rising to substantial salaries had been thought capable enough
or trustworthy enough to deal with it. The experiment, for
the best of reasons, was pronounced satisfactory, and then
after a while new responsibilities were heaped upon these
twenty expectant scapegoats, whose expectation proved to be
their only comfort. They were eventually put to “despatching”
and other highly responsible duties as these were vacated
by the clerks; others, letter-carriers, &amp;c., being brought in to
perform the primary sortation. And so this system of replacement
continued year after year until eventually the whole of
the Inland Letter-sorting Office was manned by minor establishment
men. This was a piece of official cozening that was
complete in its success. That from £200 to £400 may have
been too big a salary to pay for such work in those days
especially may be readily granted; but it certainly might have
been expected that some improvement in position corresponding
to their new duties and heavier responsibilities would have
been granted the new class of sorters. As it was, they were
left to remain on their old status as letter-carriers and messengers.
In the face of this—that Rowland Hill and the
authorities had found out a new way to get the public’s correspondence
dealt with at somewhere about one-third the
original in salaries—it seems difficult of belief that absolutely
nothing was done for this badly-treated class of men until fully
twenty-five years later. Yet such is the fact. It was not that
the men felt they had no cause for complaint; it was not
because they did not realise that they were a cheated and disgracefully-sweated
body of men. Many indeed left the Post-Office
in disgust after remaining only a few months. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
whatever discontent may have shown itself, and however justified,
there were none in Parliament yet who could be induced
to take up their cause as a body. Doubtless individual representations
were made by the score, but while they may have
been pretty well agreed by this time that they were being
duped more or less, there was still a lack of unity among
them. Besides, they were a small and obscure body about
which the general public knew next to nothing and cared less;
they were as yet without any means of making known their
plaint even if they so desired. They were without influence
as without votes. They were not only without influence and
without votes, but those who by circumstances were compelled
to tolerate the conditions of their service felt that the rigorous
rule against communicating with the press or approaching
M.P.’s directly was looked upon as having all the sanctity of
law by those outside. Even the organs of the public press
were not to be trusted, it was felt; while to communicate
directly and privately with any M.P. would have been not
only useless but dangerous. They could have taken a ready
revenge for being pestered by men with grievances but no
votes. Consequently there was never, till a few years later,
discontent open enough or of such a nature to draw public
attention.</p>

<p>At this period the London letter-carriers were principally
confined to the chief office, St. Martin’s-le-Grand, and as the
grades of stampers and sorters were mainly drawn from this
body, and as both were located in the same huge building, the
relationship between them was of a close connection. Whatever
grievances were felt by one class were felt or sympathised
with by the other. If there was no movement among them
answering to combination as it came to be understood a little
later; if they did not set their faces in one particular direction
by common impulse; if they as yet had no thought of gathering
in public meeting and attempting to break the silence
imposed on them by official restraints, it was not because they
were not agreed that they were an ill-used body of men. The
awakening was beginning; the signs of discontent were
scarcely concealed, but the authorities saw no reason to
inquire further.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>Already the most daring among them directed their eyes to
Exeter Hall, and some talked of the possibility of a public
demonstration. As was very natural, the majority hesitated
about taking a step which had scarcely before been attempted.
It was like exploring an unknown country, and they could only
guess at the difficulties and dangers ahead. No one was certain,
either, how the public would receive any demonstration of
aggrieved postal servants. It might be regarded as an exhibition
of downright disloyalty by those without, and as rank
mutiny by the authorities within. It might even be looked on
by the public at large as the beginnings of a postal strike;
while it was feared that the press would prove anything but
friendly. If it did not hold their puny efforts up to scorn and
ridicule, it might hamper them in no small degree, and alienate
any little sympathy they might be able to command among a
few influential public men who had quietly promised to assist
them to get the matter looked into. It was such considerations
as these that caused the proposal to hang fire for a
period.</p>

<p>About 1855, however, the discontent among the London
letter-carriers began to express itself in something like organised
effort. A committee was formed, and small subscriptions were
collected to defray the expenses of hiring a hall in which to
hold public meetings. The principal ground of complaint
was, as usual, the smallness of salary as compared with the
high price of provisions and increasing house-rent, and the
withdrawal of payment for extra duty. It appears that while
the men had been allowed the opportunity of adding to their
slender wage by making sixpence an hour for overtime, they
bore with the conditions of the service uncomplainingly. But
they very justly regarded the withdrawal of this payment for
extra duty as incompatible with the increased pressure of work
imposed upon them. The meanness which few private employers
would care to be found guilty of was unblushingly
practised by a State monopoly upon its poorest and most
defenceless menials even at this early period. But the letter-carriers
were not without spirit, and not without spokesmen to
protest on their behalf. On the 13th January 1856, a meeting
of letter-carriers was for the first time convened to ventilate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
their grievances and prepare the terms of a memorial to the
Postmaster-General. The memorial was accordingly drawn
up, but the memorialists—which principally consisted of the
fourth or lowest class of letter-carriers, and therefore the
poorest paid—committed the fatal mistake of allowing its
publication in the press before presentation to the head of the
department. This fact was seized upon by the then Postmaster-General,
the Duke of Argyll, as in itself sufficient
ground for refusing their claims, and it was intimated to them
that the step was so improper in the circumstances that even
had the memorial been found reasonable in itself his Grace
would have found it difficult to take it into favourable consideration.
In the second annual report of the Postmaster-General
the “misconduct” of the agitators was severely
animadverted on, but his Grace in conclusion expressed his
willingness to make allowance for “misconduct arising out of
excited feeling,” and desired to take as lenient a course as was
consistent with due regard to the discipline of the office. He
therefore satisfied himself with reminding those who had shared
in these “objectionable proceedings” that henceforth no
annual increment would be granted without a certificate of
continued good character from their superiors.</p>

<p>Having regard to the circumstances and the times, perhaps
they had some cause for congratulation that their offence
had been passed over so lightly. Certainly it must be said
that the Postmaster-General of 1856 showed an example in
lenity which a successor of twenty years after would have
done well to copy, and which would have shown him in more
consistent accord with the growing and expanding spirit of
reform.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly there was ample justification for the discontent
which centred in the recent memorial from the letter-carriers.
The conditions of the service for them and the
lower ranks of postal operatives especially were perhaps not
what they should have been, a recent slight improvement
notwithstanding. But they were better off than they were to
be a year or two later. Things were bad in the Post-Office;
but if the plain truth be told, probably the position of the
letter-carriers rather favourably compared with the lot of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
outside, whose occupation and calling bore the nearest analogy
to theirs. For, though the department had committed itself
to a policy of rigid economy and profit-making, and had definitely
assumed a position of subserviency to the Treasury, it
had not yet fully entered on that of cheese-paring parsimony
at the expense of its humblest workers which was later on to
so characterise it the more as it became wealthier and mightier
in its operations and its ambitions. Certainly, it had assumed
to think its servants well paid on a starvation pittance, but
presumably it still felt some little compunction for their bodily
comfort. And this was something in those days when labour
had few rights and no privileges. With a curious inconsistency,
while it kept the letter-carriers on a wage too low to
enable them to live decently, and deprived them of a means
to add a shilling or two to their incomes, it actually expressed
a philanthropic concern about the manner their poor pay and
prospects compelled them to house themselves. The dwellings
of the letter-carriers for some time became the object of
the authorities’ benevolent attention; apparently on the assumption
that a slave-owner may consistently pose as a good, kind
master, it at least pretended to take a paternal interest in the
domestic welfare of these humble public servants still complaining
of too little pay. It was suggested that some sort of
postal barracks for letter-carriers and their families should be
erected near to the General Post-Office. It was thought that
they would enjoy a greater immunity from sickness, but more
especially would it be convenient to the department to have
them within easy reach, so that they might summon them by
bugle-call, and shepherd them in one big drove whenever big
mails arrived from abroad. Doubtless, also, it entered into the
calculations of the authors of this proposed pretty little postal
commonwealth, that they would be better able to keep an eye
on the morals of their employés, and preserve their good
characters. The authorities, however, shrunk from the responsibility
of erecting and maintaining such barracks at the
cost of the Government. They did not trust their pet scheme
so far as that. The Duke of Argyll, whose original idea it
was, thought the prospect one more suitable for a public company,
but it was stated in his report that the department<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
might afford aid by “securing to the company its rents, deducting
the same from the wages” of the letter-carriers. The
Postmaster-General of the period may have been animated by
the best of motives; but it is observable that no part of the
cost was to be borne by the department, nor were the men,
already poorly paid, to be assisted in paying for the extra convenience
to the department. The report of the medical
officer on the matter discloses the conditions which the low
wage of the letter-carriers compelled them to live under. A
perusal of this report alone, it seems, provides sufficient excuse
for the letter-carriers’ claim to better pay as servants of the
State. And the Duke of Argyll, by the publication of the disgraceful
facts, provided an unanswerable indictment against
his own judgment. It has to be remembered that these were
the days before workmen’s trains, when the neighbourhoods
around the city were almost as congested as at present, and
several times more squalid. The medical officer’s report
showed that the great demand for house-room, and the convenience
of living near their work obliged these men to live
in single apartments, for the most part low, imperfectly ventilated,
and “in many cases totally unfit for habitation.” “In
some of them the officers who have lodged there have taken
smallpox, scarlet fever, and similar contagious complaints.…
All the cases of smallpox and fever that have come
before me during the last six months have occurred to officers
living in such tenements.”</p>

<p>And yet the public servants compelled to live amidst such
surroundings were reprimanded for their “misconduct” and
“objectionable proceedings” in daring to ask for that slight
increase of pay which would enable them to improve the very
conditions which his Grace of Argyll so deplored. The Postmaster-General’s
dream of a contented little postal Utopia
nestling under the shadow of St. Martin’s-le-Grand was, as a
matter of course, never attempted to be realised; nor was
the slightest compensating advantage given to the neglected
men. Yet it must however be stated, to the credit of the
authorities of those days, that though they refused any improvement
in pay or prospects, they offered the men good
investment for their money in the way of an insurance scheme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
for their benefit. If they could not better provide for their
employés while living, they made amends to them when
dead. The Post-Office was willing to provide a decent
funeral cheaply for any of its servants whom death from ill-nutrition
and overwork had saved from becoming State
pensioners. It was a happy stroke and a bold one in the
direction of economy, and a clever experiment in State
Socialism, for which the Duke of Argyll was to be eminently
commended.</p>

<p>Still, when all is said, and when all allowance is made for
the times, the Post-Office as an employer was no worse than
many a factory and many another huge workshop. It was
certainly no worse than it was itself destined to become on
the departure of the dukely pseudo-philanthropist from St.
Martin’s-le-Grand. If there was one thing in postal administration
during this time which called for praise it was the
earnest solicitude after the health of the staff. The earlier
reports from the medical officers of the Post-Office are
examples of completeness, and display a patience, a research,
and a suggestiveness, as well as a desire to improve the
sanitary conditions and working environments of the staff,
which is all the more creditable, seeing that the Post-Office
then employed only a tithe of the vast army which to-day
crowd and toil within its walls.</p>

<p>Yet, painstaking and conscientious as these annual reports
on the health of the staff continued to be for the first few
years of their appearance, they were by virtue of their very
quality calculated to mislead the public as to the inner
conditions of Post-Office life. For one thing they referred
principally, if not wholly, to the staffs of London; occasionally
Edinburgh and Dublin and other large centres came in for
observation, but generally speaking too little attention was
paid to the conditions of the provincial offices and other
places. Extensively quoted and commented on as all such
reports were likely to be, they helped, despite the good
intentions of their authors, to convey a lasting impression
that the Post-Office was the best-managed and best-regulated
department of the State, second only to the army in point of
immunity from liability to disease in sanitation and general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
healthful surroundings. They conveyed the idea that the
authorities were on the whole so solicitous about the health
and comfort of their lesser subordinates that they would
temper the wind to the shorn lamb, and were only too eager
to stand between a postman and a draught even while they
resolutely refused him proper boots and a winter overcoat.
They conveyed the notion that while it was good for his
moral welfare to underpay him and put temptation in his
way, they none the less themselves endured sympathy pains
each time an epidemic of diarrhœa swept through the office.
They might be found guilty of many things, but it could never
be urged against them that they neglected to regulate the
number of microbes in the drinking-water. Altogether such
regard apparently was paid to the health of the postal staff in
these earlier reports that they gave a suggestion of an abiding
humanitarianism in postal administration which should cause
postal officials generally to regard themselves as fortunate
indeed. Only the timidly-uttered discontent among the
letter-carriers gave indication of that newly-imported spirit
of profit-mongering commercialism which in a few years was
to debauch that leavening principle almost beyond recognition.
Not that there was any conscious hypocrisy as yet
in officialdom. Through all the changes that ensued, the
authorities acted according to their conception of their moral
duty. For, up to the present, no responsible minister had
risen to accuse the Government of being the model
employer.</p>

<p>Rowland Hill, the Permanent Secretary, who by this time
had become petted and praised and honoured as the greatest
reformer of his or any other age, was nevertheless beginning
to be found out by his humbler subordinates. Among them
at least the “Monarch of the Penny Post” was anything but a
living embodiment of all human virtues. These, the little army
of obscure minions about the footstool of his gilded throne, had
found out that the idol had feet of clay. While the crowd worshipped
without, the menial servants within the temple dedicated
to his fame could not seal their eyes to his imperfections.
They were the menials on whose humble shoulders was borne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
the weight of that throne and footstool on which he rested;
and they most of all knew that their worshipful master’s clay
foot was one that could crush most mercilessly. Such was the
feeling under the surface, while the great postal reformer himself
never dreamed that those so low down would dare to
question either his wisdom or his benevolence in finding employment
for such a class of men as they. If he ever dreamed
that menials could prove so ungrateful for his inventing the
penny post, which gave them their livelihood whatever the
conditions, it is probable he did not care. Had he been
curious to find out, like another Al Raschid, how his servants
regarded him, he would have found it somewhat difficult. But
suddenly one day, in the summer of 1858, there was circulated
broadcast among the members of the London postal service a
stinging piece of satire in verse, which purported to represent
the esteem in which he was held by the rank and file of the
working staff. There is not the slightest doubt that means were
taken to ensure his getting a copy, even if his own cherished
penny post were used as the medium. If Rowland Hill ever
saw it, history is silent as to how he took it. Possibly he only
smiled contemptuously; certainly he was not the man to wince,
because the sting of an insect had found a loose joint in his
armour. Needless to say the author never came forward to
claim his laurels, nor was his anonymity discovered. The
verse, which was printed on a small handbill, convenient for

<p>There is reason to believe that the lines were produced by the
printers of the <cite>Civil Service Gazette</cite>. The lines gave an immense
amount of secret satisfaction among the class of men to
whom the poet was supposed to belong. But better was in
store. Following almost immediately on the publication of the
verse, the <cite>Civil Service Gazette</cite> announced its early intention to
ventilate the grievances of the “Fags” and “White Niggers”
of the postal service. Great was the jubilation among the
aggrieved men, for each confidently expected to borrow a copy
from his neighbour when it came out. The <cite>Civil Service
Gazette</cite> was a luxury few could afford ordinarily in those days,
costing as it did fivepence, principally owing to the paper duty
not being yet repealed.</p>

<p>It was the very first time that any public organ had shown
the courage and independence to take up in this manner the
little-known case of the sorters and letter-carriers. They were
naturally delighted, and devoured the articles with avidity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Now that their grievances had at last found ventilation in all
the glory of print, surely the day of their deliverance was close
at hand.</p>

<p>But the articles fell short of the mark. They were forcible
and telling enough—as all such articles of the <cite>Civil Service
Gazette</cite> in those days were—and they showed no small justification
for the discontent prevailing. Yet they convinced
nobody but the aggrieved men themselves; the authorities
were scarcely impressed, except with the impudence of it,
while they were read with only a qualified sympathy by the
other members of the Civil Service who chanced to take them
up. The only effect the publication of the articles had on the
heads of the department against whom they were more or less
directed was to provoke an inquiry into the authorship of what
they chose to regard as a gross literary impertinence. The
usual voluntary spies and amateur detectives were set to work
secretly to discover by their own methods who could have
been guilty of communicating the facts, or, better still, who
was the actual author, and if he had any connection with the
service. If the men knew anything at all, they kept the
secret loyally. The authorities never got beyond suspicions
which they failed to justify, and so the matter blew over.
If ever there was a postal Junius in connection with the
case, none but a few and the <cite>Civil Service Gazette</cite> knew his
identity.</p>

<p>Before leaving the matter of these articles, of which such
high hopes and expectations were raised, it may be worthy
of mention as a curious item that the interest and enthusiasm
of the men was for some time before kept alive by
the surreptitious distribution inside the office and elsewhere
of handbills issued from the publishers. Let the
handbill speak for itself, and break the silence of nearly half
a century:—</p>

<p>GROWING DISCONTENT AMONG LETTER-CARRIERS—PROHIBITION
OF PUBLIC MEETING—THE FRANCHISE AMONG
POSTAL SERVANTS AND ITS HISTORY</p>

</div>

<p>For another ten years practically the authorities allowed the
malcontents to stew in their own juice.</p>

<p>There was, however, some slight attempt on the part of the
letter-carriers to again bring their grievances under notice in
1858 by holding another public meeting in the south-western
district of London. This meeting, in the newspaper reports
of which the names of the speakers were concealed, for that
reason principally, incurred the serious disapprobation of the
authorities, and it was honoured with special reference in the
Fifth Annual Report of the Postmaster-General. Therein
the letter-carriers were severely rebuked for not adopting the
same regular course which had hitherto failed to bring them
satisfaction. One or two passages are instructive. Instead
of the proceedings being “conducted in an open, manly, and
respectful manner, the meeting referred to was held away
from the ordinary place of employment, and speeches were
made containing statements which the men who uttered them
must have known to be false, but from the consequences of
which they endeavoured to screen themselves by concealing
their names.” Lord Colchester, the then Postmaster-General,
took the opportunity to warn the letter-carriers “against the
machinations of discarded officers who, reckless of the ruin
they may bring upon others, strive to spread disaffection
in the department from which they themselves have been
removed.” Coupled with this warning there was a half promise
that, though their position was, as was maintained, a very
enviable one, their grievances would be further looked into—providing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
they complained no further and held no more
meetings.</p>

<p>A year or so later, in 1860, owing to the persistent representations
made by the various bodies comprising the circulating
department, in which they complained of insufficient
remuneration and other grievances, an Inter-departmental
Committee of Inquiry was held, composed of the principal
authorities, assisted by the Assistant-Secretary of the Treasury.
This committee occupied itself with the subject matter of
the memorials which had been presented. The result was a
report in which they recommended a slight increase of force,
and a small increase in wages. Whatever the increase of force
that was recommended, it was not before it was needed. As
for the increase of wages it was not only insignificant, but the
manner of its application betrayed it at once as only a temporary
stop-gap hesitatingly offered by a parsimonious department
anxious to obtain the most credit out of the transaction.
Before the public the letter-carriers were represented as
coming in for another departmental legacy, but the microscopic
benefit was still further diminished by being confined
to the “men now in the service,” so that “men newly
appointed to the minor establishment would come in on
the old and lesser rates of pay.” Even this slight improvement
in the conditions of the service was to be confined to
the men who had agitated and put the department and its
Inter-departmental Committee to some little trouble and
expense.</p>

<p>In the year 1866 Lord Stanley of Alderley, then Postmaster-General,
felt constrained to prohibit all outside public
meetings which were called for purposes of promoting agitation
among discontented postal officials. Lord Stanley issued
an order prohibiting such open meetings on pain of dismissal.
However it may have been justified at the period of its introduction,
it is interesting to note that successive Postmasters-General
allowed it to remain practically in abeyance for the
next twenty-five years. Either Lord Stanley’s order was forgotten,
even in the most stormy periods between 1871 and
1874, or the different public heads of the department felt a
reluctance to reintroduce it. It was not till 1890 that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
definite prohibition of the right of public meeting based on
this order was issued by Mr. Raikes.</p>

<p>The London letter-carriers at this period of 1866 were in a
highly-dissatisfied state, notwithstanding that on March 22,
1865, there had been a slight revision in the scales of pay
for sorters, stampers, letter-carriers, and supplementary letter-carriers.
The latter were in receipt of eighteen shillings, while
two classes of letter-carriers went from twenty shillings to
twenty-five, and from twenty-six to thirty shillings a week. In
introducing this improved scale of pay in a circular memorandum,
the Postmaster-General did not forget to impress on
the lucky recipients that “the benefit of their places is by no
means confined to their bare wages, and that this is especially
so in the case of the letter-carriers.” They were also once
more reminded of the amounts they received from the public
“in gratuities at Christmas—a sum which, if divided equally
and spread over the whole year, would produce on an average
5s. a week to each man.”</p>

<p>Yet though a beneficent and paternal department gave
sanction to the indirect taxation of the public to bring up the
wages of the letter-carriers, the letter-carriers themselves still
found cause for complaint. On March 1, 1866, a small meeting
was held in a public hall to decide on the best means of
letting the public and the authorities know of the chronic discontent
prevailing, and the adoption of the most effectual
means of agitating for the purpose of obtaining a higher wage.
The prime mover of this was a letter-carrier named Padfield,
in receipt of twenty-five shillings a week, and his principal
coadjutors were Sinfield and Booth. Some strong comments
were made regarding the decisions of the Postmaster-General
and upon the replies of the Chancellor of the Exchequer in
the House of Commons, which utterances, as reported, were
objected to by the authorities as exceeding the bounds of
official license. Padfield, who called the meeting and filled
the chair on this occasion, had been an active agitator for
some years, and the fact was remembered to his detriment
when this particular meeting was taken into account. The
Postmaster-General thought it would be against the interests
of discipline to retain such a man in the service, and directed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
that he be dismissed, in the hope that this single example
would serve as a sufficient warning to the others. Padfield
was accordingly dismissed in the thirteenth year of his service,
his defence that he merely took the chair to enable the meeting
to express an opinion, which he in no way directed, being
of no avail. The two minor sinners, Booth and Sinfield, were
dealt with more leniently, and escaped with a severe admonition
and a warning as to their future conduct. Booth, however,
was to reappear as a more important character later on.</p>

<p>It was this meeting called by Padfield which induced the
Postmaster-General, Lord Stanley, to put down with a strong
hand these public expressions of discontent among postal
servants. He had already expressed disapprobation of such
meetings, and could no longer think that there remained any
grievances unredressed.</p>

<p>On March 13, 1866, Lord Stanley issued a minute dealing
with the practice of holding meetings in public, and the privilege
was withdrawn. The decision come to by Lord Stanley
was that he was “determined no longer to tolerate a system
of agitation which is got up by a few turbulent men, and which
tends to create a spirit of discontent and restlessness among
the whole of the lower body of the Post-Office servants. With
this view he forbids, on pain of dismissal, the holding by officers
of the department of any meeting beyond the walls of the Post-Office
building for the discussion of official questions.”</p>

<p>The department by this time had whetted its appetite for
economy; it had at last wholly committed itself to a policy
of save-at-any-price. Had not the great oracle of reform,
Rowland Hill himself, shown the way? It was easy to effect
this by reducing postal servants’ pay in proportion as their
work became harder, and their responsibilities increased. It
was also easy of accomplishment by compelling those employed
and paid for performing inferior duties to take up
those of their immediate superiors who had been in receipt of
nearly double their wages. Not that this was altogether a new
shuffle in the game of economy, but it had never been so
effectively applied. The stampers, therefore, who were regarded
as an inferior grade of letter-sorters, were forthwith
made to take up despatching duties, those same duties practically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
for which only a few years before clerks at £200, £300,
and even £400 a year had been almost exclusively employed.
Thus was the dignity and responsibility of postal duties depreciated
still further; thus were the men given fresh causes
for complaint; and thus were the seeds of future agitation
further sown. The stampers resented it in the only way
possible, by petition, verbal and written, and by every means
of respectful protest that remained to them. The department
had not yet even learnt how to be diplomatic—it practically
left them without an answer; not even one of those characteristic
replies which have so often protracted the struggle,
by referring it to their successors for interpretation. They
thought that appealing to the men’s vanity would remove their
discontent; that by giving them a new designation they would
feel they were not so hardly worked after all. They thought that
by calling a man something else he would consent to regard himself
as less of a white slave than he was in reality. They very
magnanimously altered his official description from that of a
stamper to sub-sorter, but without the smallest difference in
point of pay or prospects in return for the newly-fixed responsibilities.
The malcontents were still ungrateful enough to
remain unconverted to the department’s point of view. They
did not mind being called anything that would befit them; a
rose by any name would smell as sweet; but if they had to
do more work of a higher responsibility, they wanted correspondingly
better pay. If anything, the discontented ones
were even more sordid in those days than those who followed
later.</p>

<p>The department had yet a deal to learn, but it played the
game with a sublime indifference to the rules of fairness,
and wondered when it was detected cheating. It had not
yet learned how to cheat with grace, and by means of forced
cards, without the subterfuge being exposed on the instant.
That was to come later. They had been so used to submissiveness
on the part of the force that they could not think
the men would have the courage to persist in their objections
now. So they thought to compromise the difference by giving
the men yet another title, that of “assistant-sorter,” and putting
them on the sorters’ scale, but with a reduced maximum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
when they should reach the top. Now the only advantage
they could afford the men as a solatium in their disappointment
was to offer them a maximum more easily attained to
by being reduced by five shillings. This was the result of a
“revision” made in September 1867. The highest wage a
man could now receive was 45s. a week instead of 50s., and
the only compensation offered for his deprivation of prospect
was an increase of 6d. in the yearly rise, and a very slight
increase on the lower scale. So that instead of taking
nearly half a lifetime to reach 50s. by twenty-seven yearly
instalments, it now took sixteen years to reach 45s.</p>

<p>Then after a while they were given the option of remaining
on the 50s. maximum at 1s. increments, or the 45s. at 1s. 6d.
annual increments. In either case it was like the promise of
a copyhold in the moon; at least so the men regarded it,
especially as the immediate outlay to the department meant
only a dozen shillings or so. But they were compelled to
accept the conditions and to take up the duties none the less.</p>

<p>Even with an unblemished character, it took perhaps half
a lifetime to reach a respectable salary. Consequently many—the
stampers, sub-sorters, postmen, and others—had to eke
out their meagre income by working at an alternative trade,
such as bootmaking, watchmaking, or other odd jobs in the
intervals which should ordinarily have been given to sleep and
leisure. One man who used to engage in “moving jobs,” he
having a little greengrocers business, was constantly late for
the afternoon duty. When called on to explain, he gave as
his reason that the Post-Office gave him his bread, and he
had to employ his spare time elsewhere looking for his cheese.
It is a trifling incident, but the reply would have equally well
fitted hundreds of others in similar positions.</p>

<p>As has already been pointed out, the bond of relationship
between the letter-carrier and the stampers and sorters was
becoming a most intimate one, and one body scarcely moved
without the other. The letter-carriers complained of poor
pay in proportion to the value of their work, and bad treatment
generally. The stampers and the sorters had their own
distinct grievances, but there was to an extent a common
ground of action between them. They had as yet no right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
of public meeting; indeed that right, conceded as such, did
not come till twenty-five years after, when it was granted
expressly by Mr. Gladstone. There appeared to be a total
absence of instruction on the matter, but it was generally
taken for granted that postal servants who were debarred the
simple privilege of recording their votes at election times,
except under most dreadful pains and penalties, most certainly
would not be allowed to convene meetings or to hire halls
for purposes of agitation. It had always been thought that
postal officials courted official outlawry by attempting to do
so. The withholding of the franchise from them encouraged
the belief, even among themselves, that they were not fit and
proper persons to engage in anything but their own business,
which was that of serving the State and the public as faithfully
as they knew how on their scanty pay. Yet it was not
till 1866 that there was any direct official pronouncement on
the matter, and it is probable that nothing but the events happening
previously provided the warranty for it.</p>

<p>The greater portion of the Civil Service at this period were
up in arms to claim their right to the franchise, and the Post-Office,
as represented by the clerical staff, particularly played
its part. The Post-Office clerks took the lead, and joined
with the rest of civil servants in the general demand to be
treated as loyal and intelligent citizens. Many meetings were
held, at which M.P.’s and influential speakers attended. Postal
servants of the lower grades gave sympathetic support, but
it must be confessed that they were as a body less impressed
with the importance of the principle than were their superiors
in the service. With them it was more a question of more
bread and butter than votes; and only a proportion of the
more discerning saw how the exercise of the franchise would
directly affect them and their position.</p>

<p>On the whole, the credit for agitating for the franchise
for postal servants must be given to the clerical staff of that
period. It is not, however, to be supposed that they were
animated by any democratic desire to extend political privileges
to such people as letter-carriers and letter-sorters. They,
as was only natural in the circumstances, played principally
for their own hand; but they helped to win the game, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
thanks of those who afterwards shared in the spoils were due
to them.</p>

<p>And here it is perhaps allowable to point out as a noteworthy
fact that it was the clerks of the Civil Service themselves
who originally were responsible for the withholding of the
franchise from all Government servants. They it was who
relinquished their birthright, and were the indirect means of
depriving future generations of it. This happened so far back
as 1782, and it was actually done at their own request and
petition. Nor was there anything particularly reprehensible
or blameworthy in their taking up such a position, as it was
done entirely for their own protection. The possession of a
vote in those days had proved more of a curse than a blessing;
and an election period meant a time of coercion and anxiety
about the security of their position under Government. In an
election they could not please both parties, and their votes
being solicited by rival factions, woe to them if they did not
vote on the lucky side. At this time the existing Government,
through the votes of public servants, controlled no less than
seventy seats in the House of Commons. Just before a
General Election, Lord North, who had been in power for
twelve years, took a high hand by sending notices to those
constituencies where the votes of Government servants were
likely to turn the scale, that unless they voted for his party,
it would go very hard with them in the event of his being
returned to power. This was a threat and a warning serious
enough in itself, but it was rendered more so by the opposite
party retaliating in a like fashion by also sending out notices
to the effect that there was a likelihood of their coming into
office, and that if they did not give their vote, such Government
servants would find themselves in a very awkward predicament.</p>

<p>A strong petition was sent up pleading for disfranchisement,
and a bill was introduced shortly after the formation of Lord
Rockingham’s administration, which was to deliver ministers
from temptation to tamper with civil servants, and the better
to secure the freedom of election. It is a somewhat surprising
fact, looked at in these days, that this bill was warmly
contested in all its stages through the House of Commons.
But it was eventually passed by considerable majorities, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
in no division were more than 110 members present. At that
time it was regarded as a very necessary precaution to have
passed this Act (22 Geo. III. c. 41), as it was computed that
the Revenue officers formed nearly twenty per cent. of the
whole electorate. While the Government of the day wielded
such power over the destinies of civil servants because of the
possession of these votes, and that in point of fact they could
by this means influence no less than 140 votes in the House
of Commons, it was perhaps far better that civil servants
should be disfranchised. But the natural consequence was
that all Post-Office servants, whatever their rank, high or low,
were excluded from the use of their votes; and this in course
of time gave rise to a very grave injustice.</p>

<p>While citizen liberty was everywhere expanding, and the
greater majority of the artisan and labouring classes were being
gathered into the widening folds of the British electorate,
those who happened to serve the Crown in any capacity had
to pay for the privilege by the sacrifice of their vote. From
allowing too much liberty to Revenue officers and those
serving under the Crown, the Government rushed to the other
extreme, and an Act was passed in the pre-Reform days
(7 &amp; 8 Geo. III. c. 53, s. 9) by which the provisions of former
Acts were amended and extended still further by increasing
the penalty to be inflicted on any Revenue officer (including
postal officials) for voting at election times while still in his
Majesty’s service, and for two months subsequent to leaving it.
The penalty was increased from £100 to £500. An officer
in the Post-Office was not merely liable to this heavy penalty
for recording his vote, which in the ordinary course was allowed
him as a citizen by the law, but on conviction was declared to
be for ever disabled and incapable of holding or executing any
office of trust under the Crown, if he committed the heinous
crime of voting at Parliamentary elections. The great Reform
Act of 1831, which came to be hailed with such joyous satisfaction
by the whole community, afforded no relief to the
Post-Office official, and it was not till a quarter of a century
later that they were thought worthy of being entrusted with a
vote. However this deprival of the franchise may have been
justified in Lord Rockingham’s time in 1782, times and circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
had materially changed when the middle of the
nineteenth century arrived.</p>

<p>Such was the paradoxical position taken up with regard to
postal servants and all those who served the Revenue, that
while they were invariably men of selected character and
selected intelligence and education, generally introduced into
the public service through the highest influence to vouch for
their integrity, they were not thought trustworthy enough to
use a vote with common honesty and discretion. The absurdity
and injustice of the position could not fail to arouse in course
of time the opposition of those affected. In those days the
future brilliant critic and fighting editor of the <cite>World</cite>, Edmund
Yates, and Anthony Trollope, the future novelist, were in the
Post-Office; and these, in co-operation with Messrs. Frank
Ives Scudamore, Chetwynd, and Ashurst, threw themselves
into a movement for the removal of such electoral disabilities.
The Inland Revenue was represented by Messrs. Dalbiac,
Jacobs, and Alaric A. Watts, and the Customs by Messrs.
Dobell and Hamel. These, the representatives of the Post-Office,
the Inland Revenue, and the Customs, resolved themselves
into a committee. A circular was issued to the members
of the service, and the support of members of Parliament was
obtained, and among these were included Mr. Charles Buxton,
Sir Harry Verney, and Mr. Charles J. Monk. The discontent
with the existing political restraint placed upon them in a
short time pervaded all ranks and sections of the Civil Service;
and, feeling that the retention of the present disabilities was
a slur on their intelligence, and a stigma on their character
for loyalty, the agitation for their removal was entered into
with earnestness. This was the first organised attempt to
obtain the removal of the disabilities in respect of voting and
taking part in Parliamentary elections, which invidiously differentiated
all Revenue officers from all other civil servants
of the Crown. But it was to prove nearly a nine years’ hard
fight before they were to take back what had been so hastily
thrown away by a previous generation of civil servants. Beyond
a few private members no minister could be induced to give
countenance to what had almost come to be regarded as an
impossible demand.</p>

<p>When the Reform Bill of 1867 was passing through the
House of Commons, Sir Harry Verney, who had warmly
espoused the cause of the disenfranchised civil servants,
proposed a clause enabling Revenue officials (who were otherwise
qualified) to vote at elections, but, on the recommendations
of both Mr. Gladstone and Mr. Disraeli, this clause was
negatived without a division. Yet this part of the proposal,
at any rate, vehemently opposed though it was by the Government
of the day and the leaders of the Opposition, was to be
within two years embodied in a statute of the realm. Each
forward step taken by the friends of enfranchisement was
contested by the occupants of both sides of the House; and
every argument that could be devised for and against was
imported into the discussion.</p>

<p>It was due to Mr. Charles J. Monk, the member for Gloucester,
that the first breach in the Opposition was made.
From the very first he had been struck with the unfairness
of excluding educated and selected men in the Post-Office,
Customs, and Inland Revenue from the exercise of the
franchise, while their brethren in all the other departments
of the State could freely vote and take part in elections.
The principal high official argument, used in its many
variations, was that it would be an unsafe weapon to place in
the hands of men who might use it for furthering excessive
demands, and for general purposes of agitation. Mr. Monk’s
reply was in most cases to the effect that “if these officers
have just cause of complaint it is far better that the grievance
should be brought before the House by their Parliamentary
representatives than that it should be left to seethe below
the surface, or be brought to light through irregular channels.”
It was early in the session of 1868 that Mr. Monk introduced
his Revenue Officers’ Disabilities Removal Bill. Slowly and
inch by inch it was carried through all its stages in the House
of Commons, defeating the Tory Government of Mr. Disraeli,
on the motion for going into committee on the bill, by a
majority of thirty-two. This was certainly a triumph for the
friends of Reform, considering that the Government had the
support of the Leader of the Opposition in opposing the
measure. Lord Abinger took charge of the bill in the House<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
of Lords, when the Lord Chancellor, Lord Cairns, much to
the astonishment of the peers themselves and many others in
the Lower House, supported the measure most strongly. This
was sufficient to ensure its success, and it speedily passed into
law (31 &amp; 32 Vict. c. 73).</p>

<p>During the subsequent Parliament, 1868-1874, Mr. Monk
made several attempts to complete the measure of enfranchisement
by enabling officers engaged in the collection and management
of her Majesty’s revenues to take part unreservedly
in the election of members to serve in Parliament. But he
was invariably opposed most strenuously by the then Prime
Minister, Mr. Gladstone, and it was not till another Parliament
had been elected, in 1874, that he was enabled to
accomplish that object by passing one other measure (37 &amp;
38 Vict c. 22) through Parliament, with the concurrence of
the Chancellor of the Exchequer of the new Government, Sir
Stafford Northcote.</p>

<p>The services of Mr. Monk in getting passed the measure
of 1868 were still appreciated by the newly-emancipated
postal servants and others; and Mr. Frank Ives Scudamore,
Assistant-Secretary to the Post-Office, on behalf of the
Revenue Offices generally, presented him with an illuminated
address, expressive of their gratitude to him for his skill and
ability in carrying their “Bill of Rights” successfully through
Parliament, “in despite of formidable opposition.”</p>

<p>If it was the higher grade of civil servants who for their
own protection threw away their right to the franchise, it was
the same class who recovered it, and who were instrumental in
procuring it even for their humbler subordinates in the postal
service and elsewhere.</p>

<p>During the progress of the agitation among nearly all Civil
Service bodies to obtain the franchise, discontent was becoming
all the more acute in the Post-Office. Doubtless the contemplation
of practically the whole Civil Service engaged in
furthering a united demand, in no small degree gave an impetus
to the growing postal movement, and helped to develop
the forces of discontent within.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<p>FORMATION OF AN ORGANISATION—BOOTH, THE LETTER-CARRIER—CONDITION
OF THE LETTER-CARRIERS—PROPOSED
PETITION TO PARLIAMENT.</p>

</div>

<p>It was scarcely to be expected that, with the spirit of discontent
so widespread among every class and section, that discontent
would remain altogether dumb and inarticulate. If
the authorities imagined that by putting their veto on the
right of public meeting discontent would in consequence
die a natural death, they were mistaken. It may have slumbered
for a while, only that there were already a few active
spirits at work among the letter-carriers. Secretly and quietly,
and almost unrecognised even among those whom he was
slowly organising, one man particularly at this period was
actively at work. His name was William Booth, a City letter-carrier.
He began by convening little hole-and-corner meetings
in all sorts of out-of-the-way places. And what was a
source of no little annoyance to the authorities, those smuggled
meetings of postal employés were more often than not reported
in the public press, though the names of the speakers were not
always given. Nor did it stop at smuggled meetings outside
the official domain; for Booth called several meetings, with
the official permission as well as without, in the letter-carriers’
kitchens. Some were impromptu meetings, carefully planned by
the indefatigable Booth, and, as usual, reported next morning.
Such meetings were generally for the purpose of shaping a
policy, and for discussing the best means of drawing the attention
of Parliament to their grievances. They were always
well attended, not only by the letter-carriers themselves, but
by every other class and section of postal employé in the
Post-Office buildings. But spies and overseers were frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
present to see that no one used a pencil to scribble a surreptitious
note. Yet, even with this precaution, to the chagrin of
the authorities, the morning papers had accurate accounts of
the proceedings. The invisible reporters were never looked
for in the proper place, for they stationed themselves by one
of the open windows of the underground kitchens which
looked into the Post-Office yard; and through these windows
every word of the speakers floated upward to be deftly caught
by the eager reporter in waiting.</p>

<p>Then, as if to test the existing official prohibition, Booth
advertised that he would lecture on postal grievances at
Cowper Street Schoolrooms, and the fact was announced by
the distribution of some thousands of handbills. The lecture
was delivered to a crowded and enthusiastic audience, and
many of the public were present. The result of this was that
the lecturer was next day called up before the Controller to
explain why he held a meeting outside the Post-Office building,
the forbidding rule notwithstanding. Booth very adroitly won
his case on a quibble, and was afterwards none the less proud
of having done so. He maintained it was a lecture merely,
there being no resolution of any kind discussed; and there
being no prohibitive rule against lectures, of whatever nature,
he submitted that he had broken no regulation. The official
Solon discharged him with a caution.</p>

<p>The agitators were by this time made aware in many
unpleasant little ways that they were constantly under the
surveillance of the departmental informers. Both on duty
and away from it they could scarcely move with freedom.
Booth especially was regarded as such a dangerous firebrand
that the department felt it advisable to keep itself acquainted
with his every movement while off duty, and for that purpose
he was constantly shadowed to find out where he went and
with whom he mixed. His house at Brixton was watched
almost night and day, and several times the official touts got
reprimanded by their superiors for reporting that Booth had
not left the house after being seen going in, when as a matter
of fact he was found to have addressed a postal meeting the
same evening. For the sake of causing their discomfiture,
and for the fun of the thing, he generally circumvented the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
watchers by getting over the back-garden wall and dodging
through a neighbour’s house into a side street.</p>

<p>In this manner principally he got together meetings of men
whose co-operation he sought, and though such gatherings
were often secret and unrecorded, they were largely the means
of setting the agitation on the move along definite lines. The
agitation from this period may be said to have been started in
a little coffee-room off Gunpowder Alley, in Fleet Street, and
from Gunpowder Alley, very appropriately, most of the squibs
to be directed against the postal authorities were prepared and
fired. It was here that the first conference of postal servants
was held, when Booth, having called together a body of representatives
from the various district offices, besought them to
assist him to form an organisation of postal employés for mutual
benefit and maintenance of rights. It was the ambitious aim
to unite the whole of the Post-Office and Telegraph employés,
to assist in obtaining by legitimate means the abolition of
Sunday work, increase of wages, and an honest and clearly-defined
system of promotion without loss of pay, and generally
to relieve cases of distress. The planks of the platform having
thus been rough hewed, it remained to nail them together.
For this purpose a small preliminary public meeting was called
in a schoolroom attached to the Borough Road Congregational
Church, which was lent by the Rev. G. M. Murphy, a notable
preacher of the day, who became an active sympathiser with
Booth and his efforts. This inaugural meeting in the little
schoolroom took place on the 17th of May 1872, when the
society was formally constituted and members enrolled.</p>

<p>At the time the bare idea of a protective society of this
kind within the ranks of the postal service was so novel and
audacious, and the difficulties in the way of its complete
success so numerous, that for some months it hung fire, and
even many of those who had joined predicted an early demise.
At any rate, the progress made was not very reassuring to
Booth and his coadjutors, who were staking almost everything
on the cast of the die. Nevertheless, the leaders worked with
a will to pull the movement together and make it presentable
before the public, and an enormous amount of work
was quietly accomplished. An extensive correspondence was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
carried on with public men and others who were to be
counted on as friendly, and who were likely to help and
encourage them in the future. By this means they awakened
an interest in their work among a numerous class of members
of Parliament belonging to both political parties, and gave
them that knowledge of postal wants which was expected to
bear fruit when the time came.</p>

<p>It was not very long before the authorities were surprised to
receive an application from the men to be allowed to hold a
mass meeting inside the Post-Office, and the loan of the
Newspaper Branch was requisitioned. Whatever may have
been the hesitation in giving official sanction to so large an
order, the required permission was, nevertheless, granted after
some delay. The object of this meeting was to discuss the
terms of a postal petition to Parliament, and possibly it was
the nature of the project which caused the authorities to
deem it wiser to confine its discussion within their own walls
than to drive it into the public arena.</p>

<p>And just here it is necessary to point out that at this time
the fraternal feeling between the London letter-carriers and
the letter-sorters was stronger than ever. The several public
meetings and the encouragement they had received, with the
numerous injunctions from outside friends and sympathisers
to keep together, begot a spirit of comradeship which sunk all
petty distinction of class, and Booth’s activity did much to
cement them. The sorters were slightly better off than the
letter-carriers in point of pay and status, but they had grievances
much in common, and they had learnt more than ever
to recognise that they were useful and necessary to each other
in the fight for freedom, a decent wage, and better conditions
of work. The army of discontented letter-carriers had been
very much increased since 1860. In that year the levelling-down
principle, first introduced in 1854 by Rowland Hill and
a Commission which then sat, was carried one step further by
the formation of an inferior grade to be known as auxiliary or
assistant letter-carriers, originally a hybrid class, something
between postal labourers and the ordinary letter-carriers.
They were badly paid and worse treated; they shared all the
misfortunes and hardships of the letter-carriers without their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
advantages as to pay and prospects. They were a cheap class
of labourers in the rich postal vineyard, for whom it seemed
the authorities thought any treatment good enough, if only
because they were cheap. Their working hours were spread
over even a greater period of the day than were those of the
full-blown letter-carriers. Their position in the service was
most precarious.</p>

<p>Their wretched conditions of service soon impelled them to
organise among themselves, but their organisation was as
feeble as their funds were shallow, and though nominally they
were a separate body, yet virtually they were to be counted in
with the general army of malcontents. They gave and received
whatever moral support was possible. They joined in
where they could; they attended the postal meetings, and
assisted in some degree towards the general betterment of
the service.</p>

<p>The condition of the auxiliary letter-carriers was so pitiable
as to cause wonder that the heads of the department could be
so short-sighted as to set up in the persons of these men,
many of them almost bootless scarecrows, such a damning
and convincing proof of postal ineptitude and parsimony.
With a class of men in the Government service working under
such conditions, it is easy to see that they were not to remain
unaffected by the prevailing epidemic of discontent. Almost
from the first they sent forth ready recruits to swell the ranks
of the disaffected. They were in themselves a reservoir of
discontent, and provided the agitation with a fresh justification,
enabling the agitators to make a stronger complaint than
ever against the authorities. If anything were wanting to
prove that the letter-carriers especially were a body of ill-used
men, these auxiliaries supplied the last piece of material
evidence. They presented a pathetic spectacle to the public
eye. The idea of a man struggling to keep himself and a big
family on fifteen shillings a week, the while to remain honest
and irreproachable, was likely to awaken the public to it as a
matter for its own concern. The auxiliaries had to attend,
whenever their services were required, at a remuneration
lower than that of a dock-labourer, being threepence or fourpence
per hour, and but for the fact that they were compelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
to engage in other callings many of them might have
starved.</p>

<p>The condition of the indoor staffs could not be so prominently
brought under the public eye, but both letter-sorters
and letter-carriers alike suffered from disabilities, and had
grievances which fully entitled them to an inquiry and a hearing.
It was not only that they were expressly forbidden by
rule to hold public meetings to discuss their grievances and
endeavour to enlist outside sympathy, or to take any public
action whatever for the purpose of removing the wrongs of
which they complained. To obtain redress of any grievance,
the only course officially open to them was to apply through
their immediate superiors; but this, with the so-called right of
appeal to the Postmaster-General, more often than not begot
annoyance and petty persecution from those of whom redress
was sought. The right of appeal especially was rendered
nugatory by the exercise of the power of damaging endorsement
on the part of officials through whose hands such an
appeal would have to pass on its way upward to the chief of
the department. Indeed, their experience in the matter of
petitions to the Postmaster-General had up to the present
amply proved that the authorities were intended to serve as a
breakwater or a barrier to resist all such appeals, and provide
the public head with ample excuses for refusal or an ignoring
of the claims of all humble subordinates. As has already been
noted, it took many dreary years of waiting or slow climbing to
reach what is to-day regarded as a decent living wage. The
rules of the department did not insist that a man should work
more than eight hours in the twenty-four, but owing to the
increase of work they were more commonly extended to ten
and sometimes eleven hours in the working day, while these
duties were usually divided into two, three, and four separate
attendances, the intervals barely leaving time for meals and
going to and from the office. All that the sorters had ventured
to ask for was that these abuses should be removed; that
their pay should better correspond to their heavier responsibilities
and the increased cost of living; that their hours should
be confined to eight in the twenty-four, and adjusted more
humanely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>The letter-carriers joined with the sorters in complaining
that their pay, thirty shillings a week after fifteen or twenty
years’ drudgery, was not a fair wage; that promotion was not
only unequal, but too slow. A peculiar grievance with them
then, as it has always remained, was that the fact that letter-carriers
were given Christmas-boxes by the public had invariably
been made a pretext for paying the men badly. Letter-carriers
who were formerly eligible for sorterships had all such
promotion closed against them; and practically they were left
without any hope of ever getting beyond their thirty shillings
a week, even if ever they got so far. A great and widespread
source of dissatisfaction too was the way in which men who
had been induced to enter the service with a fair promise of
promotion had been bilked by subsequent alterations in the
establishment.</p>

<p>There were other causes of discontent not so broadly defined,
but poor pay and lack of promotion were the main
features. Man cannot live by bread alone, but the Post-Office
made it its business to see that its servants never became lazy
through over-feeding. It sealed their lips and prevented a
public voicing of their grievances, and it almost dared them
to open their mouths too widely either for talking or eating.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</h2>

<div class="chapter">

<p>BOOTH THE LEADER OF THE AGITATION—A MASS MEETING IN
THE GENERAL POST-OFFICE—A PETITION TO PARLIAMENT</p>

</div>

<p>So the wave of discontent gathered force. By 1871 the
agitation for better pay, better-adjusted hours of duty, and
better prospects had assumed some appearance of an organisation,
though without a recognised leadership. But the man
was to come when the hour demanded him. The forces were
ready; an army of volunteers, enthusiastic and confident in
their cause, but as yet undrilled. They were not undisciplined
though, for the rules and restrictions by which they were
bound kept them in order, and strengthened their self-control.
An army of discontented Government servants thus almost of
their own free-will, and spontaneously brought together without
an acknowledged leader, without even as yet an accepted plan
of procedure, is, from this distance of time, not a little curious
to contemplate. It at once affords an evidence of the existence
of very real grievances as the impelling cause of the
men’s sincerity and of their self-command. So far, there is
not one single case of enthusiasm carried to excess; the
movement had been orderly in its growth, and in no case had
their grievances caused them to forget the respect due from
them to those who ruled over them; nor to diminish their
loyalty to the public service. It is as gratifying as it is
remarkable.</p>

<p>Here, then, at this period were the forces, two contingents
of them, ready and eager to test their strength in any manner
that was legitimate and lawful.</p>

<p>They would not shrink from the displeasure of the officials;
they knew that the frown of the Postmaster-General was already
upon them. Who then was to be leader of these irregulars?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
The man came forward when the moment arrived, and henceforth
for a few years Booth was to assume the leadership.
He was not particularly eloquent, and had no gifted fancy,
nor a tongue to form choice periods; but he had a full-throated
voice with a ring in it, a head well poised on thick-set
shoulders, and every comrade knew him for one who was
not afraid. Every comrade knew him for a man who meant
what he said, and could say it pointedly, if not elegantly.
Experience of him had taught them that what he put
his hand to he carried through; they knew that he could
formulate a petition as easily as he could knock a man
down.</p>

<p>Up to this time petition after petition had been laboriously
drawn up by committees and meekly presented by the men,
only to be ignored by the authorities, or returned as informal.
Months had been wasted in this manner, till the aggrieved men,
letter-carriers and sorters alike, got weary of waiting. They
wanted to be on the march, but none knew whither. It was
now that William Booth came to the front. The forces of
discontent were not to dwindle away for want of a man.
There was work to be done; there was a road to be made,
and here were the willing hands and the implements ready.
Booth sprang out of the ranks, and put himself at the head
of them, and facing them addressed them.</p>

<p>His first word of command was short and decisive. “To
the House of Commons!” said he. The very audacity of the
proposal for a moment almost unnerved them, but the fact
itself went a long way to convince them that their leader had
come at last. Too long had they wasted their energies and
their time on fruitless effort, and too long had they contented
themselves with standing still, or progressing slowly over the
same beaten track provided by officialdom. “To the House
of Commons!” There was something original in the idea,
and its very daring after a while recommended it. From the
armoury of the franchise they had been provided with a new
and efficient weapon; and St. Stephen’s should provide them
with a shooting-range.</p>

<p>Forthwith, under the recognised leadership of Booth, they
set themselves in this direction. The first difficulty that presented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
itself was the discovery that Parliament was guarded by
the skirts of the department, and that therefore it was necessary
to first obtain permission of the magnates of St. Martin’s-le-Grand
to draw up a petition to Parliament at all. The
liberty of the individual was more restricted than they imagined.
The franchise had been extended to them; a weapon
had been put into their hands by the Constitution; but the
authorities reserved to themselves the right to overlook their
powder and shot, and fix the firing distance for them. There
was no help for it; not even the originality of their leader
could circumvent the department in this respect. The House
of Commons, free of approach to every working-man in the
kingdom, was as yet barred to postal officials by an inquisitive
and mistrustful bureaucracy to prevent their being too rash in
their importunities. They might think themselves very fortunate
in having obtained the liberty to use their vote; but to
dare approach openly the sacred persons of those who represented
them, without first submitting their intention, was not
to be thought of.</p>

<p>Accordingly the necessary petition to the Controller of the
London postal service, asking the liberty and the indulgence
of being allowed to draw up and present a humble petition to
the people’s representatives in Parliament assembled, was prepared
and sent in. The humble petitioners waited with bated
breath, and wondered what would become of Booth when it
was realised that he was the moving spirit of the daring enterprise.
With more than usual discretion, too, they obtained
this official permission to hold a meeting to consider and discuss
the terms of the proposed petition to the House of Commons.
After some little delay, and a few further inquiries,
thought more or less appropriate and necessary, the permission
sought for was granted. But there was to be no outside public
meeting this time. Whatever they had to say must be said
within hearing of the officials and under the official roof. And
there were to be no strangers present; and journalists and
newspaper reporters were so strictly prohibited that any one
might have shot them on sight as interlopers without incurring
departmental displeasure.</p>

<p>The meeting was interesting, if only from the fact that it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
the first meeting of this nature ever known to have been held
in the Post-Office. It was quite a new departure, and the
men halted between satisfaction and suspicion. They felt
that whatever the advantage in other respects, they were
muzzled to an extent. They felt that the department was
treating them like children who could not be trusted beyond
the playground for fear of throwing stones in the street. Still,
they determined to accept the situation, and to make the
best of it.</p>

<p>The meeting was called for the 28th June 1873, to be held
after the duty, at eight o’clock in the evening, and the Newspaper
Branch at the top of the building was placed at their
disposal. For in those days, in this particular branch at least,
there was a cessation of duty after this hour. The conditions
were bad; but the Post-Office was not always at work during
the whole round of the clock; it was not exactly the ever-panting,
ever-working, never-ceasing, never-sleeping monster it is at the
present day. The floor of the branch would be capable of
accommodating over two thousand men; but it was necessary
to make some preparation. A platform was extemporised from
two or three of the facing or stamping tables, each almost of
the dimensions of a respectable platform in itself, and round
this a number of chairs and seats were ranged. The seating
accommodation was, however, principally made up of bundles
of disused mail-bags and baskets, while a considerable number,
perhaps the majority, stood. The success of the meeting from
the first moment was beyond all expectation. If any had fears
that the men would be too suspicious of attending a gathering
of this kind within the precincts of the building, and under
the shadow of the department, they were mistaken. Almost
directly the despatches were finished, and the duty done with
for the night, they swarmed in from every part. From every
other branch in the building—for the General Post-Office is a
nest of branches, like a Chinese puzzle-box—and from outside
offices they swarmed up the stairs and through every means of
entry. The men from the districts showed up in full strength,
and provided a few spectators for the platform. The branch
in its structure was admirably suited to such a meeting; it was
lofty, and there was a plentiful supply of gas-jets, depending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
in a long regiment from the ceiling. By half-past eight, the
time for opening the meeting, the vast room was crowded.
Every one was expectant and curious; this was an auspicious
occasion, and there was something of novelty in the circumstance
and the local surroundings. It was pretty well conjectured
that spies would be present, as they were generally to be
looked for at all their open deliberations. They were pretty
well known, but it would have been impolitic, if not impossible,
to exclude them. Those who were among the crowd could not
very well on the spot take notes of what they heard and saw without
betraying the real reason of their presence there. But if it
was suspected there were official spies there, it was more than
suspected, it was known almost for a certainty they had on their
side a newspaper reporter, who had been quietly smuggled in
with the crowd of district men. Thus was the prohibition of
the officials evaded; and it was said that the <cite>Standard</cite> reporter
avoided the scrutiny at the entrance by borrowing a portion
of a letter-carrier’s uniform. It was afterwards said that the
enterprising reporter found concealment in a recess beneath
the great gallery clock, which overlooked the whole of
the branch. However this may be, that there was an officially
proscribed “chiel amang them takin’ notes” was sufficiently
evidenced a few hours later, when the morning <cite>Standard</cite> came
out with a report of the night’s proceedings.</p>

<p>The floor of the branch, which when empty was like the interior
of an enormous barn, by half-past eight was black with
men. Not only did they completely cover the floor in a
dense, solidly-packed mass, but they perched themselves on the
tops of the sorting-tables; they swarmed up the tall slim iron
columns which support the roof, and clung there, thirty feet
above those below. Others more venturesome, by the same
means, found a resting-place on the higher ledges of the over-stretching
girders, smothered in dust, their heads in contact
with the shelving ceiling. Hundreds more had to content
themselves with catching an occasional glimpse of the platform
and its occupants through the tiers of empty pigeon-holes,
rising from the middles of the sorting-tables into which the
newspapers were sorted. For every one came to see as much as
to hear. A very large number from distant districts had only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
heard of him, and wanted to see Booth. They wanted to see
what kind of man it was whose audacity and whose organising
resource had so far overcome official objections as to make
this meeting possible, who had thus enabled them to beard
the official lion in his very den. The rostrum on the platform
was contrived of big square mail-baskets and some wooden
boxes covered over with mail-bags, touched up with a piece of
green baize in the middle; and by this there were sitting a few
postmen and others. Some one rose to speak, but the tumultuous
outbreak of applause kept him silent on his feet for fully
a minute. This, then, was Booth; and eyes and ears were
strained to better take his measurement, and to catch his
words—a rather short, sturdy man, with a full head and
somewhat Gladstonian features. He spoke for half-an-hour or
more, and if at first there were any waverers in the crowd,
there were none when he finished. They would have stormed
the Treasury benches that very night. Other speakers followed,
and emphasised the necessity of laying their plaint
before Parliament; and in the end a provisional committee was
elected to draw up the petition. The lines on which the
petition to Parliament was to run were to ask for the appointment
of a Select Committee to inquire into their grievances,
and their claims for better pay and improved prospects of
promotion, and the abolition of Sunday labour.</p>

<p>The petition was accordingly prepared, only however to be
returned as not complying with the standing orders of the
House. It was soon framed on more constitutional lines, and
again being forwarded through the approved channel, the
petitioners awaited the result with renewed confidence. There
was a weekly subscription among the men; there were letters
to Parliamentary candidates; there were bushels of circulars
openly posted to sitting members, the folding and addressing
being done by volunteers in their spare time in the official
retiring-rooms. Further than this, Booth now sought the co-operation
of the provincial men, and worked night and day,
often depriving himself of sleep to prepare and send the necessary
correspondence. No less a number than three million
tiny circulars were dropped in pillar-boxes all over London,
and Booth and his assistants spent hours of their spare time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
in disseminating by this means the seed-corn of discontent.
Then one morning the Petition Committee were sent for by
the Controller of the London postal service, and informed
that they had incurred the serious displeasure of the department,
as they were exceeding the bounds of a legitimate
movement. They were informed that they had not confined
themselves to formulating a petition to Parliament, but they
had become active in fomenting an agitation throughout the
entire service. They were forbidden to act as a committee,
and they were to receive no recognition from their followers,
and they were forthwith to disband themselves without calling
any meeting. Whatever protest or appeal may have been
thought necessary to save the situation was made, but without
avail. There was no alternative but dismissal. The committee
was therefore disbanded, and the affairs wound up, and
balance-sheets issued to the men, the reasons being given for
this strategic movement to the rear.</p>

</div>

<p>But it was not Booth’s way to take a defeat so tamely.
Almost immediately the organisation was re-formed on a
more definite basis than ever, with a new high-sounding title
of the “United General Post-Office and Telegraph Service
Benefit Society.” Rules were made and collections were
started; Booth was appointed chairman, and a dismissed
agitator, named Hawkins, was engaged as secretary. After the
official rebuff the men felt it unsafe to join openly, but they
none the less joined secretly, and cheerfully responded to the
calls upon their purse. Booth animated the whole movement;
and it is probable that but for him the department would
have seen it crumble to pieces, yet they probably saw that
his dismissal just then would only have strengthened his arm
against them. The authorities, however, went so far as to
suspend him from duty on some trivial pretext; and Booth
was not slow to turn the fact to his advantage. He immediately
set about organising a public meeting to be held at the
Cannon Street Hotel, 16th July 1873. The objects of this
meeting were twofold: it was to strengthen the hands of the
members of Parliament who were supporting the postal petition,
and it provided a means of protesting against the leader’s
unjust suspension. But mainly it was intended as a hint to
the Government, and as a parade of strength to show that
their Parliamentary friends were well supported by a following
in the postal service. A few days previous to the date of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
meeting a conference had taken place in the tea-room of the
House of Commons, attended by nearly every member pledged
to their support, from whom the statement of grievances, made
by Booth and several others, received a very attentive hearing.
Among the members of Parliament who had interested themselves
in the postal case were Mr. W. H. Smith, Mr. A. J.
Mundella, Mr. Roger Eykyn, Mr. J. Locke, and several other
influential members. And it was to give support to their
friends in the House that this first Cannon Street Hotel
meeting was called.</p>

<p>On the Post-Office vote being taken on Monday, 28th July,
the claims of the aggrieved postal employés were strongly
urged upon the attention of the Government by each of those
members who had attended the tea-room conference, and the
advocacy of Mr. W. H. Smith, Mr. Mundella, and others
was particularly able. The reply of the Government was,
however, unfavourable, or at least unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>The antagonism towards their claims, as voiced in the House
by the Postmaster-General and other members of the Government
on that occasion, caused Booth to decide on another public
meeting. This meeting of protest against the decision of the
Government was called also in Cannon Street Hotel, on Tuesday,
5th August, and was to be presided over by Sir John Bennett.
The forthcoming meeting was officially “proclaimed,” and the
men were warned against attending such public demonstrations;
but it was looked forward to with enthusiasm. Elaborate
preparations were made for the forthcoming meeting, and
almost all the funds in hand were used to ensure its success.
Five brass bands were engaged, and the procession of district
men then off duty, marshalled by Booth, was to start from
Finsbury Square so as to reach St. Martin’s-le-Grand a
minute or so before eight o’clock, the hour when the staff
at the General Post-Office would cease work. The district
contingents turned out strong at the place of meeting, and by
a quarter to eight the procession of postmen in uniform, followed
by an enormous crowd of sightseers, moved in the
direction of Cannon Street by way of St. Martin’s-le-Grand.
The five brass bands blared out some stirring marching tunes,
and the procession was animated with all the enthusiasm of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
men anxious of defying authority. On reaching the General
Post-Office they were quickly joined by the letter-sorters, letter-carriers,
and others, and their numbers now swollen to a big
battalion, they marched to Cannon Street Hotel as if to capture
a fortress, the bands meanwhile keeping them in step with
“The Postman’s Knock” and “Rule, Britannia.”</p>

<p>The huge hall of the Cannon Street Hotel was filled to
overflowing within five minutes of the arrival of the procession;
and the utmost enthusiasm took possession of them.
Sir John Bennett, who had already distinguished himself as
a friend of the postal workers, was punctually in the chair.
Sir John, with his snowy ringlets, his gold spectacles, his
velveteen jacket and Hessian boots, and his fresh, clean-shaven,
almost boyish features, which so belied his years, was a familiar
public character, and the postal employés felt that in securing
him for chairman they were favoured. Among those
supporting the platform were Henry Broadhurst—not yet M.P.,
but only a working stonemason; George Potter, who then
owned and edited the <cite>Beehive</cite> newspaper; and Charles Bradlaugh,
not yet either so notorious or so distinguished as he
afterwards became.</p>

<p>The speeches were stirring, and the keynote of almost every
speaker was that as postal employés enjoyed the right of every
citizen to petition Parliament, they had no need to fear the
petty restrictions of red-tape; and this inalienable right should
be their sheet anchor and their hope. At the same time the
authorities were violently denounced for so meanly visiting
their resentment on the leader Booth by suspending him without
any assigned cause; and, as may be surmised, the most
capital was made out of the incident, the action of the authorities
being ascribed to his having dared to exercise his right
as a free-born Englishman; in which, on the whole, the speakers
were probably not far wrong. Mr. M. C. Torrens, M.P., and
other well-known friends of the movement graced the platform,
and formed the necessary firing party. All the speaking from
the platform was done by the public friends and sympathisers;
the postal employés themselves significantly remaining dumb.
They had not yet the right of free speech, though they had
asserted the liberty of holding a public meeting in this fashion;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
that was to be tested later on. The public press noticed the
meeting at some length; and it acted as a splendid advertisement
for the postal claims. The next day Booth was ordered
back to the Chief Office, not, however, to receive his sentence
of dismissal as was surmised, but to be restored to duty without
suffering the loss of pay usual in such circumstances.</p>

<p>For the purpose of discussing ways and means of raising
funds to keep the fire going and sustaining the enthusiasm
of the men, there were also one or two meetings held at a
little hall known as the Albion Hall, conveniently situated in
London Wall, near to the General Post-Office. Mr. George
Potter took the chair, and Sir John Bennett, of Cheapside
fame, ably supported.</p>

<p>Sir John Bennett had proved himself one of the staunchest
and most industrious of their numerous public friends at this
period. He had an especial liking for the postmen, and any
one of them in uniform could purchase a three-guinea watch
at his shop at something like thirty-five per cent. discount.
But they were doomed to lose him in a somewhat peculiar
manner. The postal volunteer corps, the then 49th Middlesex,
had been formed on the occasion of the Fenian scare of
1868; and during a recurrence of a similar alarm from the
same causes, a number of the postmen and others joined the
corps in a body. Sir John Bennett was peculiar in his views
of postal patriotism, and dropped the postmen and their
agitation from that moment.</p>

<p>“If,” said he in his blunt fashion, “you who are agitating
for better hours and a better wage can find time to go ‘gallavanting’
about with weapons of destruction in your hands,
you have no reason to ask my assistance.”</p>

<p>It was scarcely a fair statement of the position; but he was
not to be moved further, and kept his word.</p>

<p>That, however, was a loss not to be sustained till later.</p>

<p>Not long after the great public meeting, and probably resulting
from it to some extent, there was a slight revision in the
scales of pay of the London town letter-carriers. But it was a
very niggardly affair, and the entire benefit secured amounted
to about £52 in a period of fifteen years, or a rise of one
shilling and fourpence per week, no regular addition being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
made to the maximum or minimum, while even this small
benefit was confined to a small class of about four hundred
men only. This, in the circumstances, could not be accepted
as a complete settlement of all their various claims. It was
not only quite inadequate to meet the needs of the class it
was intended to satisfy, but entirely ignored the claims of the
suburban, auxiliary, and country letter-carriers, and also those
of the sorters, assistants, and porters, many of whom stood in
even greater need of an increase of salary than the limited
number who received this slight benefit. This small unsatisfactory
scheme was rendered all the more unsatisfactory by its
giving to the inspectors a really substantial increase amounting
to 8 per cent. on their minimum, 25 per cent. on the
annual increment, and 20 per cent. on the maximum. The
inspectors who thus mostly benefited were already regarded
as comparatively a well-paid class, besides which they as a
body had contributed neither funds nor sympathy to the
agitation which had secured these benefits for them. What
was intended as a sop was only another fresh cause for dissatisfaction;
and in any case it was deemed necessary to
prosecute the agitation with renewed vigour.</p>

<p>Thereupon Booth and his associates, with a view of
strengthening the Society and definitely proclaiming their
character as trades unionists pure and simple, got the Postal
Union affiliated to the London Trades Council. They hoped
thereby to secure the co-operation of the various trade societies,
should at any time it be deemed necessary or expedient
to call for that assistance which they themselves were prepared
to render to others.</p>

<p>Again, some little time after this great public demonstration,
the leader of the agitation, Booth, found himself suspended
from duty by order of the Controller. It was not that impending
dismissal had any terrors for him, but he was determined
to avoid if possible the humiliation of it. With his
usual readiness he decided to take the bull by the horns in
his own fashion. He conceived the idea that unless some
such step as he contemplated were taken at once, his dismissal,
which he knew had been recommended, would this
time be certain. He hurried off to the printers who usually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
did such work for the movement in those days, but was told
the men could not be prevailed on to work after the usual
time. Booth said he had a job which would engage them all
night, and being told that it was quite impossible, asked to
see the men in a body. He came, he saw, he conquered,
and the men agreed to stop the night through for the production
of a cartoon which had been roughly sketched out. It
took three hours to prepare the lithograph-stone, three draughtsmen
being simultaneously engaged on parts of the sketch.
During the night and early morning four or five thousand
copies were printed off, and by ten o’clock they were being
sold like hot cakes in St. Martin’s-le-Grand and all over the
City. To ensure their sale and circulation they were virtually
given away to the street-hawkers, who retailed them at a penny
apiece. The first batch was soon exhausted, and before the
day was over as many thousands more were sold. The pictorial
lampoon had little of artistic merit to recommend it; it was
fearfully and wonderfully made; the drawing was vile even for
caricature; but the letterpress, the scriptural quotations wittily
applied, and the illustrations together, told. The broadsheet
contained four or five separate illustrations having reference
to the recent great procession of postal employés to Cannon
Street Hotel, “in defiance of official threats”; the question of
Sunday labour, hit off by the figure of a portly bishop offering
a tract on Sunday observance to an overladen postman; the
recent postal petition to Parliament, and cognate matters.
Booth, suspended from duty, was represented by a figure on
a gibbet, intended as the mental vision in the mind of the
official who had ordered it; while disposed about in odd
corners of the cartoon was a “spy-glass,” “the bullet,” “ye
sack,” labelled “Post-Office persuaders.” It did not bear
criticism, but as the work of a single night it was interesting;
and, what was more, it had some of the effect intended. The
suspended leader was restored to duty the day following.</p>

<p>What had now come to be known as the Postal Petition to
Parliament was from that moment never lost sight of by its
promoters and their followers. Booth and his little staff of
lieutenants worked night and day and every hour that their
official duties spared to them to keep the petition before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
members of the House of Commons. One result of their persistent
efforts in this direction was that they had soon quite a
respectable number of Parliamentary friends who promised to
support the motion for inquiry when it came to be raised on the
estimates. And petitioners were not content merely with verbal
promises of support, for where possible they obtained an autograph
letter embodying the promise, which letters were put on
record in the <cite>Postman</cite>, the organ of the movement. Booth
during this time was untiringly ubiquitous. He was everywhere,
and his hand was in everything, from getting out
circulars to lobbying M.P.’s. He undertook the duties of the
orderly as well as those of the captain.</p>

<p>Among the petty annoyances to which Booth had been subjected
by his zealous superiors was his being made to finish up
his evening duty at the furthest possible point from his home,
his last delivery of letters being by the Angel, Islington, he
living at Brixton. But he now succeeded in getting on a walk
by which he had to deliver the Temple, where eminent counsel
and the élite of the legal profession most do congregate. He
did this with a motive, knowing that he might make friends
among those who could command influence. He soon found
an opportunity of making himself known to every legal M.P.
who had chambers in this vicinity, while those who were prospective
candidates for Parliamentary honours no less escaped
his attention. In addition to making friends for the movement
by this means, Booth and his lieutenants—Hawkins, the secretary;
Haley, a fellow-sorter, and virtually second in command;
and others, interviewed eminent divines of every denomination
on the sore question of compulsory Sunday labour in the
Post-Office.</p>

<p>Such were the number of promises of support they received
from M.P.’s, and such were their importunities, that at last it
was resolved to hold another conference in the tea-room of the
House of Commons to discuss the petition and decide on
some action if possible.</p>

<p>Earl Percy took the chair, and among those present who
had pronounced favourably on the postal claims were Mr.
Mundella, Mr. W. H. Smith, and Mr. Roger Eykyn. A
deputation of the aggrieved postal employés had been invited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
to urge the points of the petition for a Select Committee of the
House, and these points provided arguments for better pay
and improved prospects of promotion, and the abolition of the
hated compulsory Sunday labour.</p>

<p>The conference listened attentively and sympathetically, as
conferences always do when they are composed of politicians
out of office. In the present instance the tea-room conference
was composed chiefly of Tories who coveted the seats on the
Treasury bench then occupied by the Liberals. There could
be little doubt about the honesty of the intentions of Mr. W.
H. Smith, of Mr. Mundella, or of Mr. Roger Eykyn; they
each proved it in every manner possible. They each by this
time were well informed on the postal grievances, having been
interviewed privately on previous occasions. But at this stage
of the proceedings the agitators were not quite sure how far the
good intentions of these gentlemen would be carried into practical
effect. For it has ever been a common practice with the party
in opposition, Liberals and Tories alike, just before the eve of a
General Election to gather up all the elements of discontent
throughout the country and promise support to each in turn.
But at length the men, having pleaded their various points,
came away fully assured that in the Tory party lay their principal
hope of salvation, though they were aware that some time
must elapse before their petition could come to be considered
by Parliament. Their one aim now being a Select Committee
of Inquiry, their Parliamentary policy became more active than
ever, every by-election being assiduously watched and every
candidate approached by personal interview or by letter.</p>

<p>At this time, between 1872 and 1874, agitation was rife
among all classes of labour throughout the country, and the
feeling of discontent was principally due to the cost of the
necessaries of life being out of proportion to wages. This
was followed by a general rise in wages to meet the increased
cost of living among the working population, many employers,
to their credit, voluntarily raising the wages of their employés.
This circumstance very materially strengthened the postal
claim for an increase on their wretched pay; but the Post-Office
as the greatest employer of labour would not concede
one farthing until compelled by the public and Parliament.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
The officials with characteristic obstinacy defended the state
of stagnation as to wages and promotion prevailing in the
Post-Office. On one occasion, about this period, when the
leaders of the agitation had reason to interview the Controller
on the matter, that official, who considered his wisdom was
none too well paid at £1200 a year, pointed to himself
and reminded them even he had to cut down his luxuries.
This provoked the retort from one of the poorly-paid men,
that in his, the Controller’s, case it simply meant a denial of
luxuries, but in their case it meant a denial of the very necessaries
of life for themselves and wives and families. This
might have been dismissed with an official frown as only a
mild impertinence; but the Controller, a thick-set, burly,
overfed man, unwittingly growled out the brutal truth in his
rejoinder, “<span class="smcap">We</span> don’t engage your wives and families; <span class="smcapuc">WE</span>
only want the men!”</p>

<p>But the universal rise in wages everywhere outside the Post-Office
could not but provide them with a further justification for
continuing the agitation for an inquiry. They obtained further
funds to carry on the campaign, and more public friends rallied
round them. Daily the postmen were becoming more than
ever objects of sympathy. Subscriptions flowed in steadily
from postal bodies all over the country, and a list of these
subscriptions was published in the <cite>Beehive</cite> newspaper, which
for some time past had opened its columns to the budding
literati of the movement. The postal organisation had had for
some time now an official organ of its own, the <cite>Postman</cite>; but
as it had not the weight and authority of a public organ, circulating,
as it did, among postal servants only, the assistance
rendered by the <cite>Beehive</cite> was not inconsiderable. Edited by
George Potter, who of course was in full sympathy with the
agitation, its columns placed at the disposal of the postal
cause were several times contributed to by Lloyd-Jones.</p>

<p>One postal contributor to the <cite>Beehive</cite>, who was the literary
champion of the movement, was one of Booth’s lieutenants,
a postman, who wrote under the <i lang="fr">nom de plume</i> of “Silverstick.”
The contributions of “Silverstick” betrayed no small
amount of literary merit, and were eagerly looked for every
issue by the men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>The hospitality of the <cite>Beehive</cite> was fully taken advantage of
at this time (the official organ of the movement, the <cite>Postman</cite>,
having now fizzled out), and the agitation received no small
support from its powerful advocacy. George Potter, whose
name will always be associated with public reform, gave the
postal advocates carte-blanche in the use of his organ; and the
secretary of the postal movement, Hawkins, who was employed
on it, was assisted in every possible manner to bring
postal grievances to the front. Besides the <cite>Beehive</cite> there had
been the <cite>Postman</cite>, which exclusively devoted itself to the
advocacy of their claims, and which, to an extent, rendered
valuable service by being circulated among their outside
public and Parliamentary friends. It may here be mentioned
that the <cite>Postman</cite> had been started some few years before, being
originally brought out as a small printer’s venture. It was
started at the instigation of a postman named March, who was
associated with the small printer’s business in question, situated
in Clerkenwell Close, and he was principally instrumental in
making the <cite>Postman</cite> the success it afterwards became. March,
the postman agitator, was the same March who, when he left
the postal service built up a flourishing business as a ballad
printer, supplying hawkers and street singers with topical
rhymes, coupled with the publication of more innocent toy-books
and fairy stories for juveniles.</p>

<p>The <cite>Postman</cite> was almost wholly contributed by the leaders
of the agitation, assisted by notes and scraps of interest from
various correspondents of the different branches of the service.
The circulation was kept going at this time principally by Booth
and the others. It was never allowed to be openly sold in the
Post-Office, though means were found to evade the vexatious
prohibition, and the condemned publication was all the more
anxiously looked for when the day of issue arrived. Booth
generally directed special attention to it among the postmen.
He always managed to obtain advance copies, and, knowing
the most important item of news, gave the word to be passed
round directly he came on duty, “Look on page so-and-so of
the <cite>Postman</cite>.” Before the duty was over it had circulated all
over the General Post-Office.</p>

<p>In connection with this organ of the movement it may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
of interest to mention that for a time it was machined at the
same firm as was the <cite>Court Circular</cite> or <cite>Journal</cite>; and there was
a story to the effect that these pages of the two very dissimilar
publications being of equal size, on one occasion two
“formes” of type got mysteriously mixed, and to the amazement
of the <cite>Postman</cite> readers the next issue informed them,
after reporting some of the private doings of the Queen and
Court, that her Majesty had graciously seen fit to order an
inquiry into the postmen’s grievances.</p>

<p>The leaders now decided on a third big public demonstration.
The same preparations as before were made, bands
engaged and public men written to and interviewed to get
their presence on the platform. Exeter Hall was chosen this
time as the place of meeting, and when the date, November
18, 1873, arrived the principal anxiety of Booth and his lieutenants
was as to where they should find room on the platform
for all the brilliant notabilities who had promised to attend.
The chair was this time to be taken by Mr. Roger Eykyn,
M.P. for Windsor, while their old champion, Sir John Bennett,
was once more to appear with his well-known and ever-welcome
“So here we are once again, my postman friends!”
The district contingents as before met at Finsbury Square, and
with brass bands playing and colours flying they marched to
St. Martin’s-le-Grand, where at eight o’clock they were promptly
joined by the men of the Chief Office. Then defiantly striking
up “Rule, Britannia,” they moved on towards Fleet Street, the
authorities meanwhile crowding at the windows of the General
Post-Office to watch the procession as it swept round into
Newgate Street. On reaching Fleet Street the greatest excitement
prevailed, the traffic had to be suspended, and crowds
from all parts joined in the congestion. The postal procession
was this time preceded by two red mail-vans, which, with
the postmen in uniform, gave it a tone of local colour. The
band, during its slow progress towards the place of meeting,
improved the shining hour with “The Postman’s Knock” and
“Work, Boys, Work, and be Contented,” a musical sarcasm in
the circumstances much appreciated. Exeter Hall was not
large enough to hold the immense throng who sought admission,
and an overflow meeting had to be held in a side street.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Exeter Hall platform presented a distinguished gathering of
public men supporting the chair, which was filled by Mr. Roger
Eykyn, the member for Windsor. Among those who crowded
the platform was the midget-like figure of the redoubtable
George Odger, president of the London Trades Council,
who had brought with him a deputation of trades unionists.
There were a large number of members of Parliament, and
the principal labour leaders of the day, notably Mr. George
Howell, who had already endeared himself to the postal servants
by doing an enormous amount of work for them one
way and another. The meeting was addressed by Sir Antonio
Brady and several distinguished M.P.’s, among the number
being W. Williams, M.P., W. Fowler, M.P., and A. Stavely
Hill, M.P.</p>

<p>It was at this meeting that Booth determined to test once
and for all the right of postal servants to speak in public. He
and one or two others spoke, and Booth took means to get
their utterances reported among the speakers.</p>

<p>The result was as he had anticipated. He and the others
were carpeted before the Controller. That official said that
his attention having been drawn to the reported meeting, it
was his duty to call on them to explain. There was nothing
very objectionable in the language they were reported to have
used, but the fact of speaking at all sufficiently compromised
them as Government servants. Booth and his associates were
called on for written statements, and they each defended their
conduct on the ground that they were exercising a common
citizen right in asking Parliament and the public for a redress of
those grievances which the department had refused to consider.</p>

<p>Within a few days they were again called up to listen to a
severe reprimand from the Postmaster-General. There was
some protest to a few public men, and Mr. Roger Eykyn interviewed
the Permanent Secretary on behalf of the men; but
there the matter ended.</p>

<p>The men themselves, however, feeling that their speeches
had been so studiously modest and moderate, could not but
regard such notice being taken by the authorities as both
arbitrary and unconstitutional, and opposed to the spirit of
English liberty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>Based on the resolutions passed at this public meeting, a
monster petition to the House of Commons was prepared on
behalf of the letter-carriers, sorters, porters’ assistants, rural
messengers, and others employed in the minor establishment
of the Post-Office throughout London, suburban, provincial,
and rural districts. Having regard to the increased cost of
living and the rise in the value of most classes of labour, they
submitted that the time had arrived when such an addition
should be made to their pay as would constitute a more adequate
remuneration for their arduous and responsible duties.
A Commission of Inquiry was also strongly asked for to receive
evidence on the questions of promotion, Sunday labour, and
general grievances not specified but known to exist.</p>

<p>One of the principal planks in the platform of the postal
movement at this time was the abolition of compulsory
Sunday labour for letter-carriers; and in furtherance of this
end Booth and the other agitators interviewed the most
eminent divines and religious leaders of the day. Among
those whose assistance was sought to procure a free Sunday
for postal workers was Cardinal Manning. A deputation of
Booth and two other postmen waited on his Eminence at
his residence. He was politic in discussing the question;
he sympathised with them in their laudable efforts to relieve
Sunday labour; but he hesitated to pledge himself to assist
them; he must have time to consider the matter. The
deputation withdrew inspired with very little hope from their
diplomatic reception. The truth was Cardinal Manning
hesitated to in any way assist in hampering the Government
while Mr. Gladstone was tackling the Catholic University
question. They interviewed Dr. Parker at the City
Temple, with a vague sort of hope that he might denounce
postal Sunday labour from his own pulpit. But Dr. Parker
did not prove the rigid Calvinistic Sabbatarian they imagined;
he thought that certain forms of labour were very
necessary even on the Lord’s Day, and it was desirable to
receive letters from distant friends and relations at least once
on Sunday. Even Professor Fawcett and Mr. Charles
Bradlaugh both concurred in thinking this a weak plank in
their platform, and tried to induce Booth to abandon it for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
a time at least. But Booth would not be dictated to even
by two such men as these, and expressed his determination
to try to carry it through in spite of all opposition.</p>

<p>This question of compulsory Sunday labour, as it affected
the rural letter-carriers especially, was a very sore one. Some
lines of verse written by one of their number were about this
time freely circulated. The few lines selected will show that
they possessed tolerable poetic merit.</p>

<p>[An appeal from the rural letter-carriers of England, who are employed
delivering letters, circulars, and newspapers on the Sabbath day.]</p>

<p>While this question of Sunday labour was being pushed to
the front, Mr. Joseph Chamberlain, M.P., desiring to become
Mayor of Birmingham, was approached by Booth, who
promised him the whole postal support of the town if Mr.
Chamberlain would in return direct his influence against
Sunday duty imposed on postal officials. The promise was
given; Mr. Chamberlain became mayor, but he now found
it would be inexpedient in the commercial interests of
Birmingham especially to abolish Sunday labour in the Post-Office.</p>

<p>Although the right to exercise the one privilege accorded to
every British citizen, that of presenting a petition to Parliament,
had up to now been their mainstay and the bulwark of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
personal protection, the agitators constantly found that they
were the objects of departmental attention. They had been
particularly careful, for the success of their movement, to proceed
along thoroughly constitutional lines, and nothing could
have tempted Booth and his associates to depart from this. As
has already been shown, the disappointment induced by the protracted
methods of the Government, and the antagonism of the
officials to the agitation, was such that it might easily have risen
to the point of rebellion had the leaders been so inclined; but
they were not; and as it was they had frequently to exercise to the
utmost their restraining influence on the men. It was scarcely
to be supposed that the authorities would give them any credit
for this, and as was only natural, perhaps the leaders were
held wholly responsible for the strained relations between the
department and its subordinates. Booth and his lieutenants
therefore had no mercy to expect from their superiors should
they commit themselves. The very surveillance, the constant
spying, and every manner of testing and trap-laying to which
Booth especially was subjected, would have caused any other
man with less fortitude and with a more sensitive temperament
to have given up long before he did. But to all the insidious
influences to which he was exposed, Booth especially never
showed the least concern, but went about his work as though
there were never an official to dog his footsteps even to his own
door, nor a band of the permanent officials anxiously waiting
and watching for the moment when they might reasonably
dismiss him with humiliation and degradation. In the official
mind in those days, whoever lent themselves to agitation within
the walls of a Government office could be little better than
desperadoes and conspirators, disloyal alike to the service and
the public. It was not to be wondered at, then, that they were
regarded as playing a desperate game, which, to go no further,
even as yet almost brought them within the clutches of the law.
The agitators were not blind to the position in which they
stood, nor ignorant altogether of the desire of the authorities
to encompass their destruction. Already Booth had been
most unpleasantly made aware that his private correspondence
had been tampered with in its passage through the post; that,
before reaching his hands, the letters addressed to him had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
been watched for and “Grahamed”—to use an expression which
signified the secret methods of opening and overhauling suspected
people’s correspondence then, as a survival of the
“Espionage Room,” more or less in vogue in the Confidential
Inquiry Branch of the General Post-Office. While the department
had such a piece of machinery as this at its disposal, it
was not going to confine its use to such men as Mazzini and
political personages disagreeable to the Government, and allow
the postman Booth, and others of its own household, to escape.
He had had cause to more than suspect that his letters, addressed
to those who were assisting the agitation, had been
intercepted, and their purport conveyed to the authorities who
had ordered it. To evade the prying curiosity of official
detectives and the “Grahaming” process, the letters exchanged
through the post between the leaders, and touching on questions
of policy, were thereafter directed to a fictitious “Mrs.
Harvey” at various convenient addresses.</p>

<p>Nor did departmental antagonism, both open and concealed,
to the principle of combination rest here. That the
ringleaders of the agitation had all along pursued purely
legitimate and constitutional methods to obtain redress for
their grievances, affording so few technical loopholes through
which they might be made answerable, was almost sufficient
in itself to cause the department to look on them as mischievous
breeders of wholesale contumacy and discontent,
and agitators of the most dangerous description. They might
have got rid of them one by one “on suspicion”—a process
of dismissal which carried with it an implication of common
dishonesty—only that the men had now too many powerful
advocates, and, moreover, there might have been an outcry in
the press against such an obviously hollow pretext. They
were so far saved from such a fate as had befallen others of
a lesser calibre. But they had, almost unknown to themselves,
narrowly escaped losing their personal liberty for the
part they had taken. It was only owing to an accidental hint
dropped by an eminent member of the legal profession and a
member of Parliament, who at the time was friendly disposed
towards Booth and his movement, that the whole of them
were not made the subjects of a Government prosecution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
under the odious law of conspiracy. Booth ferreted the
matter out, and learnt that the brief was already prepared.
The postal leader was given the comforting assurance that
he stood to get two years’ imprisonment, and the others
nine or six months apiece, and that the writs would probably
be issued within a few days. Such, at least, was the information
gathered, and circumstances made it extremely probable
that the Government contemplated delivering one blow which
would not only rid the postal service of a number of powerful
agitators, but completely demoralise and disorganise their followers
for years to come. If such was the motive, then the
Government was checkmated in one simple move. Booth at
the time was on the Temple “delivery,” and it was due to this
fact principally that he obtained the interest and assistance of
several eminent counsel who had either already obtained or
had an eye on a seat in the House. After piecing his information
together, so as to be morally certain that some such
<i lang="fr">coup</i> was intended, Booth the same day hastily summoned a
meeting of the executive of the postal organisation, and before
night handbills were in circulation advertising the fact that
Booth was now the sole official representative of the movement.
Next day he learnt the contemplated prosecution
was to be abandoned, for the sufficient reason that the Law
of Conspiracy could not very well be made to apply to one
man only, it taking three at least to become conspirators.
After Booth’s adroit manœuvre they could not with decency
proceed against the agitators by legal action, and so nothing
more was heard of the matter.</p>

<p>A TEST OF “THE LABOUR MARKET”—THE UGLY DUCKLING OF
TRADES UNIONISM—MR. GEO. HOWELL’S ASSISTANCE—FURTHER
DEMONSTRATIONS—THE DEPARTURE OF BOOTH.</p>

</div>

<p>Notwithstanding the numerous strong expressions of public
opinion evoked by the recent meeting of the 18th November
1873, the Government showed no disposition to meet the
moderate demands put forward in the petition to the House
of Commons. The authorities particularly seemed bent on
resisting the claims of the men. Acting on instructions
issued in a Treasury Minute issued under the previous
Government, they extensively advertised for persons to fill
the places of the letter-carriers. Yet, as a matter of fact,
there were no such vacancies as alleged in the public advertisements,
unless the department contemplated dismissing the
existing staff wholesale. The ostensible reason given was an
experiment to “test the labour market.” There was a rush
of applications, but there was a cruel insincerity in the whole
business. A large proportion failed to pass the medical
examination, while others who had passed were so disgusted
at the neglect they received, and the time they were kept
waiting in suspense, that they refused to attend for final
approval. There had been something like twelve hundred
applicants originally, and of these only nineteen were finally
passed as suitable for the situations. The fact spoke for
itself, and confirmed the opinion, generally entertained, that
it was nothing more than an attempt to damage and discredit
the case of the men, and intimidate and discourage the
“agitators.”</p>

<p>If this experiment to “test the labour market” did nothing
more, it tended to promote still further the feeling of misunderstanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
in the minds of the general public, and assisted
to obscure the issue.</p>

<p>However, the aggrieved postal employés, as represented on
the London Trades Council, were accredited trades unionists.
The trades unionists of the Metropolis, little as they understood
their case, were compelled to take them into partnership.</p>

<p>By this time the efforts made by the postal employés had
attracted considerable attention from every quarter; but trades
unionists generally were almost as much at a loss to understand
the precise nature of their claims as were most people,
and there was much need for information. From the press
reports and allusions to the matter in Parliament from time to
time, a vague notion existed that postal employés were badly
paid, and wanted better treatment, but little was known as to
the real objects sought, or of the means by which they were to
be obtained. The peculiarity of their position, the fact of
their not being handicraftsmen in the generally-accepted sense
of the term, caused their movement still to be looked on as the
ugly duckling of trades unionism, and many were against allowing
its claim for kinship. It was principally due to Mr. George
Howell that this feeling of misunderstanding was removed.
The condition of the postal employés and their battle for
liberty was for the first time brought prominently before the
trades unionists of the country at the Sheffield Trades Union
Congress, January 1874. Mr. George Howell was secretary
of the “Trades Parliamentary Committee,” and as a special
delegate of the Postal Society, he read a paper which most
clearly and convincingly showed that postal servants were in
need of sympathy and moral assistance from the organised
labour of the country. To the majority present it came as a
revelation that those in Government employ were so restricted
in the matter of civil rights. In thanking Mr. Howell for his
valuable paper, they desired to express their sympathy with the
movement of the postal employés for increased pay, better
regulation of the hours of labour, the abolition of Sunday
work, and a just system of promotion. The Congress recommended
their cause to the trades societies of the United
Kingdom, as well worthy of support.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>The first General Election of 1873-4 had come and gone,
and Mr. Gladstone found himself again returned to power,
but with a majority of only forty. He immediately dissolved
the House, and forthwith appealed to the country a second
time.</p>

<p>The country was again in the throes of a General Election,
and towards the fag-end, and before the result was certain for
either party, another meeting of postal employés was called
again at Exeter Hall. Meantime a written letter was sent by
the Society’s secretary, Hawkins, to every Parliamentary candidate,
asking for support in their demands. Nearly one hundred
of those who gave their pledge were eventually returned to the
new Parliament.</p>

<p>When it became known that preparations were in progress
for holding another meeting, the authorities issued an official
edict threatening with the penalties of insubordination any one
found attending. They liked the Cannon Street Hotel meeting
but little for the unenviable publicity it gave the department,
but the prospect of the Exeter Hall meeting they liked
still less. The meeting was again “proclaimed,” but a full
two thousand attended, notwithstanding. Again there was
music and banners, and a procession through the streets, and
two thousand or more filled the vast space confronting the
historic platform. Mr. Mundella took the chair on this
occasion, and was supported by several Tory M.P.’s just
returned triumphant from the poll. There was among
them Mr. Ritchie, Mr. William Forsyth, Captain Bedford
Pim, and Sir Charles Dilke. There were a number of eminent
clergymen, among them the Rev. John Kennedy, D.D.,
and the Rev. Hugh Allen. The latter reverend gentleman
generally prefaced his remarks at postal meetings with the
words, “Those who distribute the correspondence of the
country, distribute the wealth of the country, and their pay
should be in proportion to their responsibility.” This agreeable
sentiment was at once appropriated as the motto of the
movement, and it figured on the stationery, and more than
once on their banner. There was also the Rev. John Murphy,
well known at the time as the “Bishop of Lambeth,” who had
assisted right through the struggle till now. Altogether the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
platform presented a gathering of eminent men of almost every
degree.</p>

<p>Mr. Mundella, as chairman, was just about finishing his
address when the herculean form of Charles Bradlaugh was
seen hurriedly pressing his way on to the platform. As the
heretic agitator took his seat not far from that region of the
platform sanctified by the presence of so many clerics of
different denominations, there were some signs of dissent
among some of the postmen in front. It almost immediately
subsided with a wave of the chairman’s hand; and at Booth’s
request Mr. Bradlaugh was given fourth place among the
speakers, as he had to leave early. The several other speakers
spoke, and it came to Bradlaugh’s turn. But immediately his
huge form rose from the chair there was a hostile demonstration
which gradually swelled in volume. Mr. Mundella
requested the postal leader, who was sitting beside him, not
to insist on Mr. Bradlaugh being heard. Charles Bradlaugh
himself, always considerate in the interests of his friends and
those whom he wanted to assist, thought his speaking might
mar the success of the meeting, and made as if to leave the
platform; the “booing” and groaning continuing meanwhile.
They had not till now been ashamed to listen to and take
counsel from the freethought lecturer “Iconoclast,” and many
who now groaned at him had cheered him to the echo when
it suited them. The hostile demonstration was probably
only their way of paying a compliment to their reverend friends
on the platform, though there were one or two, at least, among
them who had come to assist in this good cause who would
not have hesitated there and then to burn the heretic amidst
a bonfire of his own godless pamphlets kindled with the light
of sacred truth.</p>

<p>“You see, Mr. Booth, they will not hear him,” said Mr.
Mundella, rather testily. But “Bulldog” Booth, as he was
now known among his intimates, was not to be beaten. “Then
dissolve the meeting, sir,” said he stoutly. “But they will
hear him.”</p>

<p>The chairman rose and succeeded in calming the storm;
and Mr. Bradlaugh essayed to speak. He had always been
an active sympathiser with the postmen and the postal movement.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
It was not the first time he had stood before them.
Once on his feet with a determination to make himself heard,
he would not be denied. A towering figure, a leonine head,
and huge, pale, clean-shaven face, with its mastiff’s mouth, he
looked as ugly as Mirabeau, and as tremendous. Yet there
was the charm of simplicity and a conviction of earnestness
in his utterance, which made them feel ashamed at his reception.
He spoke for four minutes, and adjured them to
maintain the principle of combination; to stick together, to
exercise their rights as citizens and to use their votes, and to
support those who supported them. When he had finished,
Bradlaugh received probably as loud an ovation as any who
followed. A number of the clerical friends of the postmen
naturally took the line of denunciation against forced Sunday
labour, and their utterances for the most part were curiously
reminiscent of those speeches on the self-same topic on that
same platform twenty-five years before.</p>

<p>Among other eminent labour leaders and Radical politicians
of the day there figured George Howell, who never failed the
postmen in their need, and who had interviewed perhaps more
members of Parliament and the heads of the Government than
any other public man; for at this period it had particularly fallen
to Mr. Howell’s lot to represent their case in this manner.</p>

<p>Shortly after this great Exeter Hall meeting the society published
a balance-sheet, which clearly showed the enormous
amount of work involved in the previous two years’ crusade.
During the two years of agitation, numerous meetings, both
reported and unreported, had been held; they had carried the
war into almost every part of the kingdom, they had interviewed
public men innumerable, prepared and got signed
three monster petitions to Parliament, and attained to the
dignity and importance of occupying the time and attention
of the House of Commons more than once. The general
correspondence of the society during the two years of its existence
had involved the writing of no less than 2546 letters;
while to the public press communications to the tune of nearly
2000 had been sent out. But, altogether, during the two years
nearly 14,000 communications were addressed to Parliamentary
candidates, M.P.’s, public men, and others. Truly, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
Post-Office had been made to direct its hand against itself.
Among the list of subscribers were the names of several public
men, including Canon Liddon and Sir Charles Dilke.</p>

<p>The organisation of combined postal servants was now
being perfected in various ways. Interviewing members of
Parliament, both privately and at the House, was now almost
of daily occurrence; and Booth and the various others were
on terms of intimacy with most of the prominent men of the
day.</p>

<p>It was this time a Conservative Government in power, and
those members who wished to show a desire to redeem their
promises convened a conference of the known Parliamentary
friends to the postal cause. For the Exeter Hall meetings
had had a marked effect on the press and the public. The
conference was therefore called at the Westminster Palace
Hotel, a stone’s-throw from the House itself. It was to be
quite public, and reporters admitted. A deputation of the
aggrieved men attended to urge their case once more. Mr.
Roebuck was this time in the chair; and Mr. Stavely Hill and
numerous other influential and well-known M.P.’s formed the
self-appointed jury. Booth once more went over the old
ground of their grievances; and Haley, another postal agitator,
also gave an able exposition of their simple claims, which appeared
to impress them favourably. The immediate result of
the conference was that Mr. Roebuck, on behalf of his colleagues,
promised to do an indefinite something as soon as
found convenient.</p>

<p>They so far redeemed their pledge and showed their confidence
in the justice of the postal claims as to privately urge
the Government to take up the matter. For a month or so
there was a superficial quietude among the discontented men.
There were no meetings, but the postmen and the letter-sorters
were subscribing to the general fund. There was no
further interference on the part of the officials, probably from
the fact that they were now beginning to recognise that the
movement was too strong, and rendered stronger by press
sympathy and public support. Eventually Mr. Roebuck—“Tear
’em,” as he was called in reference to his pugnacity
in the House—brought up the matter of the postal case for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
inquiry on the Estimates. Booth, Haley, and the rest of the
leaders of the agitation were found a place under the gallery,
by the side of Sir John Tilly, the secretary, and Mr. Scudamore;
for in some things the House is no respecter of persons.
The debate was eminently interesting, and brought out all the
points of the postal case in a marked degree.</p>

<p>The reply of the Government was unfavourable; and the
argument, which has done duty so many times since, that
there was really no just cause for complaint, was then used for
the first time, and set an easy precedent, which nearly all
succeeding Postmasters-General faithfully followed.</p>

<p>After the debate the leaders of the agitation crowded round
the members in the lobby, Roebuck particularly was besieged
by the disappointed men; but he shook himself free of them
with the air of a man who had done his duty, and was determined
to court failure no further. “Tear ’em” Roebuck
was evidently chagrined and as annoyed as his clients, and he
turned on them almost with a snarl. “You see I can do no more;
the Government won’t interfere,” said he, and strutted away.
The Government had left them to their fate; but pressure was
privately brought to bear on Lord John Manners, who was
now Postmaster-General. The refusal of the Government to
interfere on behalf of the oppressed and aggrieved postal employés
after all the promises of the Tory party, and after all
the patronage extended to them publicly, resulted in such a
feeling of resentment and disappointment among all classes
of the service, that Booth the leader had the utmost difficulty
in holding his followers in check. There was, indeed, one
abortive attempt at a strike among the Hull postmen, and the
spark might have ignited the whole had Booth and his associates
given encouragement to it. It wanted but a breath
from the agitators at this moment to fan the whole into a
blaze.</p>

<p>Booth during this time never lost heart; he was as indefatigable
as ever; scarcely a day passed but what he interviewed
somebody or was himself interviewed. He had carried the
art of interviewing to such an extent that he several times
personated the secretary of the postal movement, Hawkins, for
the purpose of getting editors and pressmen to say a word or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
two in behalf of the baffled, but as yet not defeated, agitation.
By personating his own secretary in getting himself interviewed
he thus evaded the official rule which forbade any postal servant
communicating with the press, and which there is little doubt
would have been mercilessly enforced against any one in the
service caught doing it too openly. But however little they
had to expect from the permanent officials, they felt that with
a Postmaster-General as representative of the party from which
only recently they had received so much sympathy and patronage,
active hostility would not be allowed to be carried too
far. Moreover, they felt pretty safe in conjecturing that, come
what may, what the law officers of the late administration had
hesitated to carry to a completion would not in a hurry be
resorted to under the new Government of the party which
included so many tried and pledged friends of postal reform.
True, the Conservative Government, which the postal vote
had in some measure helped to bring back to power, had so
far disappointed them in not at once taking up their case as
they were led to believe it would. But they were aware that
their grievances were still occupying the attention of a large
number of the members on both sides of the House, and that a
large amount of influence was being brought to bear on the
Postmaster-General. From Lord John Manners there was
still something to be hoped for. And this hope was sustained
by the plausible rumour that the Government’s refusal to
inquire into their grievances was only a diplomatic way of
empowering the Postmaster-General to do all that might be
found to be necessary towards ameliorating the conditions of
the service over which he had been put to rule. Yet the
cloven hoof peeped out in an unexpected manner, and sooner
than was to be looked for.</p>

<p>Lord John Manners, so long as he was in opposition, had
not declined to be counted among the Tory supporters of
Booth and the postal agitation, he having replied in favourable
terms to letters and circulars soliciting his support towards
obtaining the asked-for inquiry. There is perhaps always
some allowance to be made for one newly taking office, and
inconsistency is to an extent allowable, if not to be looked for.
But it came as a surprise and something of a shock to Booth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
especially to learn that the new Postmaster-General, resisting
all overtures from those of his own party, was about to set his
face uncompromisingly against their claims and against the
representatives who might urge them. Certainly, on the face
of it, it seemed a wonderfully gracious act in a Postmaster-General
to consent to receive a deputation of the men for the
purpose of hearing once more from their own lips the story of
their grievances he was already so well acquainted with. An
application for an interview had been sent forward, in itself
perhaps a piece of audacity almost unheard of, and to the surprise
of the men themselves it was intimated that the interview
would be granted. It was granted, but only with the condition
that Booth should not be present. By the time that this
was announced Booth had got over his first surprise, and was
quite prepared for the intended snub, but scarcely for the unjustifiable
insult which followed. It had been previously
arranged that he should lead the deputation, but it was now
officially conveyed to him that the Postmaster-General, while
willing to see a deputation of the letter-carriers and sorters,
must refuse to receive Booth “on account of his official bad
character.” There was a feeling among the force that if the
Postmaster-General would not see the leader the deputation
ought not to go forward, but Booth put himself out of the
question, and advised them to meet the head of the department
and to obtain what advantage was possible. It was
therefore decided to do so; but the undeserved insult, though
inflicted on the man, was none the less felt to be aimed at the
principle of combination, and their hopes were overshadowed
with the suspicion that the interview was granted mainly for
the purpose of better marking the agitators for future reference.
The Postmaster-General’s treatment of Booth was scarcely
likely to reassure them or to maintain their confidence in his
fairmindedness. Throughout the agitation Booth had been
careful not to run foul of his superiors on official matters, and
his official character had been good enough to please Lord
John Manners and his party before the last General Election.</p>

<p>The deputation to the Postmaster-General was memorable
if only from the fact that this was the very first occasion the
public head of the department had ever consented to receive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
representatives of the working staff. It looked like a concession,
and as such would read well in the Tory press
especially. But the men in their hearts were prepared for
the disappointment which was to follow, and anticipated that
it was the Postmaster-General himself who intended to get the
most out of the interview.</p>

<p>A few weeks afterwards, about the beginning of August, a
scheme was announced. But it proved to be nothing more
than an inflated bubble which, when pricked, contained only a
few paltry advantages for the letter-carriers. The advantages
were small enough in all conscience, amounting to some
small increase in pay and benefits as to stripes for good
conduct.</p>

<p>But small as were the benefits, the letter-carriers so appreciated
them that they decided to continue the agitation no
further, and Booth, not without reluctance, resigned his
position as the postmen’s leader. The only return Booth
got for all the labour and all the responsibility he had taken
on himself was that he was left with a debt of £35—a no
insignificant amount to one in his position. By the aid of one
of his friends he was able to obtain a loan, and with a
characteristic independence paid it off without troubling the
men with his private affairs. It was not that his followers
proved ungrateful; they simply did not know the condition in
which the agitation had stranded him; and perhaps he was
too proud to inform them. There was the usual effort to
testimonialise him and those who had most assisted him; but
the thing was badly managed. An illuminated address was
already prepared for Booth, and it was shown to him at his
private house. There was also a purse of money subscribed,
which would have proved a little fortune to him in the
predicament, but there was some little sordid dispute among
one or two who fancied themselves entitled to an equal share.
This treatment so aroused the contempt of Booth that,
seizing the illuminated address, which he regarded as more
than conventionally insincere in the circumstances, he passionately
tore it to fragments before them and flung it into their
faces, ordering them to leave the house immediately. He
refused to touch a penny-piece of the money subscribed; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
instead set himself steadily to work to pay off the debts he had
incurred on account of his connection with the agitation. So
far, if the department wanted its revenge, it had it now.</p>

<p>Booth having freed himself from debt, shortly afterwards,
owing to failing health, applied for and obtained the small
pension of about eight shillings a week he was entitled to.
And so departed one of the most persistent as well as one of
the most courageously-consistent agitators the Post-Office or
any other Government department has ever been troubled
with. Booth’s career as an agitator had been a brief one, but
it had been as brilliant as it was brief. And perhaps, after all,
there was some truth in his claim that he had largely assisted
to overturn two Governments and put in another.</p>

<p>FORCED LABOUR—A GENERAL POST-OFFICE RIOT—A POSTAL
POET—THE WANING OF THE MOVEMENT—THE PUBLICATION
OF A MEMORIAL—WHOLESALE DISMISSALS.</p>

</div>

<p>At this time, and for long previous, there was no definite
eight-hour day officially recognised for the working staff at the
General Post-Office. That was a privilege as yet definitely
enjoyed by few besides the clerical establishment. If there
was any official rule regulating and limiting the working hours
of the rank and file, that rule and those regulations were
vitiated by the practice of the supervising officials. The men
were subjected to nothing less than forced labour; the hours
which should have been given up to sleep and leisure were
extorted from them; and forced contributions of their well-earned
liberty were remorselessly levied upon them. They
were liable to be summoned back for duty at any time during
their intervals of rest. There was no assured time for rest or
proper sleep. They were compelled to dispose of incoming
foreign mails without remuneration of any kind. As the department
had decided such mail matter must be disposed of
without cost, at first the men had to rotate for this purpose,
and it generally fell to their turn about once a month. In
former days this practice may not have constituted a great hardship;
but when, owing to the increased and improved means
of transit across seas, foreign mails arrived several times a
week, it became a very real grievance. American mails
then arrived only about once a month, instead of daily as at
present; but there were other mails to be taken account of,
and their arrival and treatment were often delayed for disposal
by this cheap method. If the practice had stopped at the
monthly summons, or an extra attendance for every man every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
week or so, the strong discontent arising from it might have
been averted. But the principle of extorting from men already
too poorly paid and harshly treated, this disgraceful poll-tax
in time was still further extended after a while.</p>

<p>The occasion which principally provided the officials with
an excuse for imposing on the force still further was the introduction
of the halfpenny post; and when this came to be
recognised by the public as a boon, the men became the
victims and the sufferers. The reduced rate for newspapers
and circulars was soon taken advantage of by company promoters
very largely. The notorious promoter, Baron Grant,
who did everything on a colossal scale, sent in prospectuses,
referring to the Emma Gold Mine, at the rate of half a million
at a time, completely swamping the Newspaper Branch, where
such correspondence was disposed of. The authorities’ only
method of meeting the emergencies which so frequently arose
was to get the extra work of the public (which already meant
so much more profit to swell the revenue) done by forcing the
overburdened and underpaid men to do it for nothing in the
time which should otherwise have been theirs. The method
of forced labour, so analogous to that form of slavery which
aroused the righteous indignation of the civilised world when
practised a few years later by the Boers on the unfortunate
Kaffirs, was not only thought proper but persisted in by the
officials of an English Government department. Whatever
excuses, if any, that might be made for the rapacious East-End
sweaters, could not be made for the profit-minting
monopoly of St. Martin’s-le-Grand and those who guided its
machinery.</p>

<p>The men protested again and again, but without avail.
Refusal to comply with this form of tyranny or worse, imposed
in the name of duty and discipline, would have meant rank
insubordination, punishable with dismissal without character.
Probably their protests never got beyond the branch superintendent,
to whom they complained; but the authorities ought
not to have been wholly blind to the men’s treatment. If
there was no Treasury grant of money to cover the cost of
extra duty of this nature, as was pointed out, then the parsimony
and meanness of the authorities was only to be excused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
by their utter laziness in not endeavouring to get such a demand
met honestly and fairly.</p>

<p>The grievance speedily attained to the dimensions and
importance of a grave scandal. Yet the authorities seemed
determined that, kick and struggle against the pricks as the
men might, they should submit to it. And the men, grown
weary of complaining against the injustice, and losing all faith
in the fairness of those over them, were equally resolved that
it should not continue much longer without one last vigorous
protest from them. The climax of indignation was reached
one morning in March 1873, when the whole of the force were
ordered as usual to stay behind their time. There were mails
above and below in the Newspaper and Letter Branches, and
tons of circulars waiting in reserve. The men rushed to their
kitchens, and securing their articles of clothing, made for the
principal exit leading to liberty and the Post-Office yard. This
they found closed and bolted against them and guarded by a
posse of overseers, the official doorkeeper, and numerous amateur
policemen—constables disguised as sorters. They were sternly
ordered back to their duties; but by this time, even if they
would, they could not turn for those now pressing behind and
thronging the lobby. The officials appeared on the scene and
exhorted them not to disobey orders; but the murmurs that
arose convinced them that at last the mutiny had come. The
men demanded the door to be opened and the removal of
the constables. They took it as an added insult that such
Siberian methods should be put into force against them, for
whatever their humble position in the public service, yet still
they bore the name of free-born Englishmen. The officials,
convinced they were acting within their right, refused and
repeatedly ordered them to fall back. For half-an-hour or
more the men, nearly a thousand strong by this time, endured
it; the heat was oppressive in the closely-packed crowd, and
the stubborn obstinacy of the men guarding the door was
making the crowd excited. There were cries of execration,
and from the rear came a hurricane of balls of twine with sticks
of sealing-wax. The officials retreated to safer quarters, leaving
the men guarding the door to carry out their duty or die.
The lobby, which was a narrow neck of space leading from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
Letter Branch to the coveted doorway, was becoming like the
Black Hole of Calcutta, and many men were on the point of fainting.
The doorkeepers were pale but determined, and stood with
their backs to the coveted door. The situation was as serious
to them as to the mutineers themselves. With the men the
injustice of the official instruction to stay at their duties without
pay might be sufficient to palliate their disobedience to it,
especially when there were nearly a thousand of them to answer
for it. But with those at the door it was slightly different;
they had to do their duty, and they looked like men who were
determined to sell their lives dearly if it came to it, though it
is probable that if they could have trusted each other the bolt
would have been quietly drawn. To those in the thick of the
swaying, sweltering crowd of angry and excited men the heat
was getting unbearable. Some one, or several at once, suggested
rushing the doors; but to deliberately break down the
barrier seemed to spell mutiny of the worst kind, and numbers
of the front ranks held back at the prospect of afterwards
being named as ringleaders. The responsible officials retired
to a distance and watched with the grim satisfaction of
schoolmasters who were “keeping in” a refractory class of
school-children. The realisation that they were being kept
prisoners at the behest of one or two of their superiors was
intensifying the impatience and the excitement of the sweltering
crowd behind, and impatience soon grew to desperation. The
air was repeatedly filled with groans and hisses, and the storm
of groans was presently turned by some one facetiously striking
up a bar of “Britons never, never shall be slaves!” That
was enough, for the men behind especially. They remembered
they were Britons. A square of infantry with fixed bayonets
could not have stopped them now. They were solidly packed
several hundreds strong in one long stream, fed every moment
by reinforcements as they gained courage to leave the sorting-tables.
Fortunately some one by an adroit manœuvre had
turned a line of heavy mail-trucks and trolleys, placed there
either carelessly or purposely, or the result might have been
disastrous to those in front. Menaces and shouts were directed
towards the men who barred their way; but neither threats
nor appeals would move them, and it seemed they would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
flattened against the door they were so zealously guarding, for
those in front could no longer hold against the mighty pressure
of the hundreds behind. The crowd heaved and rocked like
a huge billow. There were shouts and groans and some were
real, a tremendous scuffle, a sound like the cracking of ribs,
a crash of woodwork, a shattering of glass accompanied with
a louder yell; the doors burst from their fastenings, and the
hot perspiring stream of angry men vomited itself into the open
air and the daylight. Then the wild mob’s several hundred
feet scattered down the steps into the Post-Office yard, and
the men who had broken their red-tape bonds to assert the
liberty of the person again burst into such a roar of triumph
that a jaded horse on the cab-rank outside in Aldersgate Street
took fright and bolted. The untoward commotion stopped
the stream of traffic in St. Martin’s-le-Grand, and crowds
assembled outside the Post-Office railings while the police
hurried to the scene from every by-turning. The general
traffic was disordered for half-an-hour, till the last remnant of
the imprisoned men issued from the gates.</p>

<p>As the result of the scrimmage several men got scratches
and bruises, and there were one or two bloody noses. It
ought to have been as much a matter for congratulation for
the authorities as for the men that nothing more disastrous
occurred. But the officials chose not to see it in that light,
and several who had been grabbed in the rush by the doorkeepers
were haled up like escaped convicts before the presiding
superintendent and others of the smaller authorities to
answer for the conduct of the whole. Six men were there and
then suspended from duty without pay for an indefinite period,
and with the prospect of dismissal before them.</p>

<p>It was only to be expected that the public would take
an exaggerated view of the incident; and the idea gained
credence that a veritable riot had taken place inside the Post-Office.
Some, indeed, thought it meant a postal strike. The
evening paper came out with an account of the “Riot at the
General Post-Office,” which, it need hardly be said, was
scarcely accurate.</p>

<p>The humour of the situation was skilfully hit off a day or
two later by a parody on “The Light Brigade,” by one Tom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Glamorgan, already recognised as a postal poet. It was said
the verses were scribbled hurriedly on his shirt-cuff during
moments snatched from the duty the same evening; and
being printed next day were sold for a penny a copy amongst
the sorters and postmen and others, the small sum realised
being sent to some charity. The actual verses perhaps would
interest but few, but the printed paragraph introducing the
lines epitomised the whole incident The print formed one
of a short series of “Postal Fly-sheets,” and the paragraph in
question read as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">“<span class="smcap">Insubordination at the General Post-Office</span>.</p>

<p>“On Monday morning, 31st March 1873, a large quantity
of ‘Circulars,’ the postage of which amounted to some hundreds
of pounds, were required to be sorted and despatched to their
various destinations. The men, assistants, and boys worked
well till 9 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span> (having been on duty since 4.30 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span>), at which
time the juniors struck work and congregated around the
lobby door to depart; several of the older officers were
stationed there to prevent their exit, the ‘Acting Superintendent’
on duty declaring they should not go till all the
work was done. The assistants and boys replied to this by
tremendous shouting, hooting, hissing, groaning, and pushing,
declaring they would do no more that morning unless
paid extra for it. At length some of the ringleaders, assisted
by the crowd around, continued to push against the officers
guarding the doors, striking at one of the ‘overseers’—<em>breaking
hose from all order, discipline, and control</em>.…”</p>

</div>

<p>The six sorters, innocent or guilty of the charge against
them, were still suspended, but the resentment of the authorities
did not stop here. One of the official doorkeepers was
pounced on to account for his not successfully resisting the
several hundred determined men who so forcibly objected to
be made prisoners of. The doorkeeper was rather a small
man, and built more on the lines of a jockey than of a gladiator.
But it was useless to urge such a fact on the official mind
bent on inflicting condign punishment. So the poor little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
man was pronounced guilty of failing to perform a feat which
would have baffled Hercules. He was in consequence reduced
to an inferior position entailing greater responsibility;
and failing to become competent in a duty which was entirely
new to him, he was incontinently bundled out of the service
on a starvation pension of six shillings a week. He did not
long survive his defeat, but died a little while afterwards of a
sheer broken heart.</p>

<p>That the so-called riot at the General Post-Office was only
one of the straws which showed the way of the wind may be
taken for granted. Whether it could have occurred in a better-regulated
service is perhaps doubtful.</p>

<p>The scheme which with its small benefits had given so
much satisfaction to the letter-carriers as to induce them, if
not to remain satisfied, to abandon agitation for the present,
had caused corresponding dissatisfaction to the letter-sorters.
The only benefit derived from the Manners scheme, if it
could be called such, was the increase of sixpence a year
in the increment. The keenest disappointment prevailed, and
a movement was already afoot to find expression for that
disappointment in a memorial to the author, Lord John
Manners. Yet, though the feelings of the men were scarcely
concealed, it had been officially represented to the Postmaster-General
and the Controller that the demands of the sorting
force were now fully satisfied, and that the men themselves
acknowledged it. This official misrepresentation was followed
by an anonymous note being pinned on the notice-board in
the retiring-room. It was to the effect: “Who thus misrepresents
the spirit of the Inland Branch? As mild a
mannered man as ever scuttled ship or cut a throat.” The
note was detached and taken to the superintendent; and
one of the men, Glamorgan, who had already distinguished
himself in the line of a satirical verse-maker, was suspended
for some days on suspicion of being its author.</p>

<p>At the end of November 1874 the dissatisfied sorters drew
up a respectful and moderate memorial to the Postmaster-General,
pointing out that “whilst grateful for the recent
improvements made in … pay and prospects of promotion,
they were yet unable to accept so small a revision as a satisfactory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
settlement of their claims to increased remuneration,”
and giving some very valid reasons for a reconsideration
of their case. The petition was signed by 140 men as
representative of the entire sorting force, and presented
through their immediate superior. To the startling surprise
of every one, a copy of this memorial appeared in the
<cite>Times</cite> and other morning papers the next day, and from
that moment the most discerning could see that it was
doomed to failure from the fact of being published in the
press before the Postmaster-General had had time to consider
it. For in those days especially such a thing was regarded
as a most unforgivable breach of official etiquette, to say
the least. Its publication at this juncture was therefore
generally thought to be the last blow to all their hopes of
further revision. But few dreamed what was to follow.</p>

<p>The text of that memorial is here reproduced, the better
to mark the perverted sense of justice of the Postmaster-General
who could read treason and conspiracy in an
innocent appeal so temperately worded, and exact so cruel
a penalty for so small an offence as that of prayerfully submitting
that they still had grievances to remedy.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Petition to the Postmaster-General</span> from the
Sorters of the Inland Branch, G.P.O., presented
through their Superintendent on November 25th,
1874.</p>

<p class="noindent">“<i>To the Right Honourable</i><br />
<span class="smcap">Lord John Manners, M.P.</span>,<br />
<i>Her Majesty’s Postmaster-General</i>.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,—We, the undersigned sorters attached to the
Inland Branch, beg most respectfully to inform you that,
whilst grateful for the recent improvements made in our pay
and prospects of promotion, we are yet unable to accept it
as a satisfactory settlement of our claims to increased remuneration;
we, therefore, beg to call your Lordship’s
attention to the following facts: Prior to 1867 the scale of
pay for our class was as follows: Minimum of second-class,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
23s., by an annual increment of 1s. to a maximum of 38s.;
minimum of first-class, 40s., by an annual increment of 1s.
to a maximum of 50s. After the revision made in June
1867, it stood thus: Minimum, 24s., by an annual increment
of 1s. for six years, and then by 1s. 6d. to a maximum of 45s.
In 1872 the minimum was increased to 26s., and in July of
the present year the scale was again altered to the following:
Minimum 26s., with an annual increment of 1s. 6d. for
six years, and then by 2s. to a maximum of 45s. Thus it will
be seen that whilst the minimum and annual increment have
been increased in amount, the maximum has been reduced
5s. per week. The only benefit derived from the last
revision was an addition of 6d. to the annual increment. In
former memorials we have asked that the increased increment
of 2s. per week may begin at the minimum of the scale
instead of after six years, as at present; and also, that the
maximum may be restored to the sum of 50s. per week, at
which it originally stood, in accordance with the recommendation
of the Commission of 1854, of which the present
Chancellor of the Exchequer was a member. The scale
would then have stood thus: Minimum, 26s., by an annual
increment of 2s. to a maximum of 50s. We respectfully
submit to your lordship that, having regard to our length
of service (most of us have served over nine years), the
increased value of labour, and the enhanced cost of commodities
generally, the above would not be more than a
reasonable remuneration for the important duties we perform.
We therefore pray your Lordship to give this Memorial your
favourable consideration, and earnestly hope you will see
fit to grant our Prayer. We are, my Lord, your obedient
servants.”</p>

<p class="center">[Here follow Names.]</p>

</div>

<p>The resentment of the department showed itself almost
immediately after the illicit publication of the memorial in
the public press. The signatories were sent for by the Controller,
and catechised as to what they knew about its appearance
in print before it had actually reached the hand of the
Postmaster-General. They were told it was a gross breach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
of official confidence, only a little less heinous than offering
personal insult to the public head of the department. They
would be held responsible for sending it to the press for publication,
and nothing now remained but to go home and pray
for forgiveness and await developments. In vain the men
protested their innocence, and pointed out that copies of
the proposed memorial freely circulated among the men for
their approval before it was submitted through the official
channel; indeed any one but themselves might have forwarded
a copy to the <cite>Times</cite>. But it was to no purpose they
sought to defend themselves on these grounds, and they were
practically found guilty on the spot. That was one indictment
only in regard to this unfortunate memorial. The second
was that they had dared as the humblest servants of her
Majesty’s Postmaster-General to convey to him, by means of
this aforesaid illicitly-published memorial, that they could not
accept as fully satisfying all their claims, the scheme which
he had so beneficently prepared for them. What right had
they to say they could not accept the scheme, or anything else
which a Postmaster-General had so condescended to provide
them with?</p>

<p>The poor menials withdrew from the light of the official
cadi’s presence, abashed and crestfallen. They predicted that
something was about to happen to them, guilty wretches that
they were; but they did not know what.</p>

<p>While the case was pending, a paragraph appeared in one
of the papers to the effect that the indignation of the men in
the General Post-Office had now reached such a point that
they had decided to petition for the removal of certain supervising
officials who had rendered themselves brutally obnoxious
to the men throughout. The ringleaders were again, as a
natural consequence, suspected of this fresh paragraphic insult
to the department; but the men themselves were as indignant
as might be the authorities themselves. They all solemnly
protested to each other that this foolish blunder was not theirs.
The appearance of such a thing at this moment could certainly
effect no good purpose, and it seemed difficult to believe that
any one of them, knowing that suspicion would most certainly
fall on them, and discredit them still further, could have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
guilty of such foolishness. Still, repudiate it as they might,
they knew the shot would rebound on themselves. There were
several among them who did not hesitate to think, that both
the memorial and the offensive paragraph had been sent to the
press by some one of the creatures of the department with
a malignant ulterior motive.</p>

<p>If the Postmaster-General had been shot at with a popgun
he was going to return it with a bomb; and the bomb, being
ready, was primed for the 11th of December. On the morning
of that date it was thrown.</p>

<p>It took the form of a Postmaster-General’s minute, and was
sent the rounds of the Circulation Department by means of
the general-order book. It started innocently enough, but the
sting, like that of the scorpion, was in its tail. It was to the
effect that the Postmaster-General had received the memorial
from the sorters, but not until it had been improperly published
in the newspapers. It proceeded to criticise the terms of the
memorial, and to remind them that in the previous July the
wages of the memorialists were readjusted by the Treasury,
“after very full and careful consideration.” A comparison
between the sorters of 1854 and 1874 was then drawn to show
that they were no worse off, and that the reduction in the
maximum was more than compensated for by the creation of
a new overseer’s class. So far, so good, or bad, as they chose
to think it; but now comes the cruellest part of it. The
Postmaster-General could not stay his hand here. In view of
the recent settlement he felt it incumbent on him not only to
oppose and check the spirit which the terms of the memorial
and the course it had taken exhibited, but “to evince in some
unmistakable manner” that he would “not yield to clamour
what reasoned justice to the public would withhold.”</p>

<p>Accordingly he desired that the memorialists be informed
that if their present conditions of service were not suitable to
them they were at liberty to seek for other employment. And
further, he would understand it to be their intention to do so
unless within three days they asked, in writing, for permission
to remain. This permission, however, he should not give to
those who, having signed the memorial, bore an “indifferent
character,” and were “not recommended by their superior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
officers for retention in the service.” He understood that
among those who signed the wicked memorial there were a
number of younger men who had “no claims on the department,
either on the score of service or otherwise”; and for
daring to become dissatisfied already, their names were to be
brought specially before him, in order that he might consider
whether any, and if so, which of them, should be retained in
the service as an act of grace. His lordship furthermore
implied that the precious privilege accorded to the more
poorly paid of being allowed to add to their miserable incomes
by overtime, should relieve them of any cause for complaint in
regard to insufficient wages. His reference to their “liberty
to seek for other employment” was the bitterest mockery to
men who had given so many years to the public service, and
for the first time gave expression to that heartless theory of
the department that the best cure for grievances was the dismissal
of those who dared to complain of them; for that
practically was its meaning.</p>

<p>Such was the message of Lord John Manners to the men
who had been guilty of asking for a redress of their grievances
and a small increase of pay. Such was the manner in which
he requited the confidence reposed in him by his humble
subordinates, and such was the manner in which he set about
redeeming the fair promises of the party which had so sustained
the agitation while they were in opposition. The
Postmaster-General’s minute was almost as vile an instrument
as that with which the late Government had contemplated
crushing combination and smothering the claims of the aggrieved
by prosecution, only that their heart failed them at the
last moment. It was virtually a demand for the heads of the
ringleaders. It provided a warranty for wholesale dismissal,
and placed a weapon in the hands of minor officials which,
apart from their inclination, they were fully authorised and
expected to use against a certain number.</p>

<p>They were told that they were to consider they had relinquished
the service, but applications to be retained would be
considered, though there would be no guarantee. As was
only natural in the circumstances, the men, thinking of their
wives and families, and knowing that refusal to accept the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
humiliation meant instant dismissal, complied, and wrote
their applications as directed. An overseer was sent round
to collect them into a bunch, and then it was the poor men
found themselves, as if drawn into an ambush, basely betrayed.
Their last lingering confidence in the honour of the
aristocrat who made blue blood only the criterion of nobility
was rudely shattered. The whole thirty men who as representing
their fellows had been induced to sign the memorial
were suspended from duty, with the prospect of dismissal, the
forced humiliation of their applications notwithstanding.</p>

<p>A fortnight before Christmas one hundred and forty men
of the sorting force were called up before the Controller for
admonishment. These included the thirty suspended men,
who were taken last. They were all admonished in much the
same terms in the name of the Postmaster-General, and to the
majority it was intimated that the granting of their applications
would depend on their future conduct. But five of the
men, those regarded as more or less prominent in the recent
agitation, were to be dismissed; and the five condemned men
were accordingly marched out of the office, with a bitter winter
and the world before them.</p>

<p>Lord John Manners triumphed, and the smaller officials
had their revenge. There was no doubt about that; the men
went back to their duties thoroughly cowed. It must have
been a glorious hour for the Postmaster-General, and doubtless
he felt that he had routed the enemies of society for ever.
And so that the victory of the Postmaster-General should be
fully complete, a subscription to provide the dismissed sorters
with a Christmas dinner was stopped by order of the authorities.
Cowed as the men were, an attempt was made to send
round a subscription-sheet, but the movers were warned of the
consequences, and they were officially terrorised into doing
nothing for the victims of Lord John Manners’s discipline.</p>

<p>Several Parliamentary friends of the postal cause immediately
set to work to induce the Postmaster-General to reverse
his harsh decision. Particularly assiduous was Mr. A. J.
Mundella, but he was doomed to get nothing but humiliation
for his pains. Mr. Mundella used the whole weight of his
personal influence with the Postmaster-General and the permanent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
authorities, only to find himself bandied about from
one to the other till his sensitive nature became wounded and
disgusted. The studied discourtesy shown him by the permanent
officials especially he made a matter for some complaint
inside the House, as he felt that more consideration
than had been accorded him was due to his position and
dignity as a public man.</p>

<p>These arbitrary dismissals destroyed the last vestige of
confidence in the Tory party for some years to come among
the letter-sorters. If the men had been dealt with merely
for signing and sending forward a memorial, there was no
justification for such harsh punishment. There would have
been no justification for any kind of punishment, beyond
the refusal to accede to their request. But it was rendered
too patent to every one that it was seized on simply as a
pretext for taking a revenge for the part they had played in
the recent agitation. There was no discipline that demanded
such a cowardly reprisal. It was worthy only of the narrow-minded
aristocrat whose principal claim to distinction was his
cherished little drop of blue blood, and whose contempt of
the masses, of all who worked for their living, and all that was
plebeian, was rendered shamefacedly notorious by his published
lines. For Lord John Manners was the author of that silly and
impudent pretence at an epigram—which shook the world with
laughter, and covered the writer with derision and scorn—even
from critics of his own party. His disgraceful lines, which
ran—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">“Let Arts and Commerce, Laws and Learning, die,</div>
<div class="verse">But leave us still our old Nobility!”—</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">of which he was so distinguished an ornament—were as much a
perpetration on decency and the canons of poetry, as his very first
act as an administrator was arbitrary. Where he had failed as
a poet his party had generously given him a chance to succeed
as an autocrat. And his one idea of autocracy presumably
was to persecute the weak, as the only way to convince them
he was powerful.</p>

<p>Lord John Manners was a poet, and a poetic revenge was
to be wreaked on him by one of his victims. The generous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
impulse which had prompted the defeated men to subscribe
for a Christmas dinner for those who had suffered for them,
had been promptly strangled by the officials acting under the
direction of the Postmaster-General. So it was attempted to
raise a small sum for the distressed men by the sale outside
the Post-Office gates of a leaflet bearing the following impression:—</p>

<div class="chapter">

<p>INTRODUCTION OF BOY LABOUR—CONDITIONS OF SERVICE—DEATH
OF COMBINATION AND ITS CONSEQUENCES—POSTAL
HELOTISM.</p>

</div>

<p>In the meantime, as if to contemptuously show that the agitating
sorters could be dispensed with at any time, or their work
done by child labour, the authorities, when the halfpenny
post started in 1870, introduced a number of lads recruited
mostly from boys leaving school. This was the introduction
of the boy-sorter system, and while it presently assisted the
department to play off against the men who were fighting for
a better wage and other improvements, it efficiently furthered
that principle of economy which was to be the all and end-all
of those who governed. The department was henceforth to
be run on commercial lines more than ever it had in the past;
the more profit the great machine produced the more it might.
The introduction of the boy-sorter system was yet another
experiment in levelling down, and yet a further depreciation
of their work, for which twenty years before the respectable
salaries of clerks were paid. It was justified in so far as it
provided an outlet for the telegraph messengers later on,
whose only chance hitherto had been to go as postmen; but
that economy was almost the sole object with the authorities,
was almost proved from the miserable wage that was offered
these boys. Ostensibly, they were brought in to do the rough
routine work of assisting the sorters, and of carrying bags and
gathering in the correspondence for disposal. But in a very
short while they were, in addition to these menial tasks, put to
the more arduous and responsible duties of sorting, and work
almost identical with that of the ordinary sorters. For this
these boys received six shillings a week—errand-boys’ wages.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
And the men who had been through all the rough times of
the service for ten, fifteen, and twenty years past were still
agitating for better wages and better conditions of work. This,
to an extent, was the answer of the authorities. The introduction
of boy labour to displace men discontented with their
conditions was the best card they had yet played, and one
which they calculated to check the further operations of the
sorters, at least. It was not long, however, before there were
some signs of dissatisfaction among the poorly-paid youngsters
themselves, besides which it was becoming difficult to obtain
the required number, and it was soon necessary to raise their
wages to nine shillings a week. The responsibilities of their
work increased proportionately, and soon there was little
appreciable difference between the work attached to them and
that on which ordinary sorters in the Newspaper Branch had
been engaged. The only sop that was thrown to the overworked
and underpaid stampers and sorters of this branch of
the service was their being allowed to present their sons as
candidates for the vacancies; though whether it was that they
evinced too little sympathy with a scheme which might mean
their own undoing, or that they were too disgusted themselves
with the conditions of the service to think of bringing in
their boys to share such prospects, is not certain; but few
availed themselves of the opportunity. Not even the rise in
wages to nine shillings a week for boys from fifteen to seventeen
years of age, constantly surrounded with temptation to
pilfer, and who were more or less saddled with work and
responsibilities for which more wages had been paid only a
short time previously, was any too generous for a profit-making
public department. The boy sorters were emboldened
to draw up a respectful petition urging a claim for a further
improvement in pay. The petition was intercepted by a
minor official, who smelt sulphur in it at once, and several of
the poor boys were forthwith charged with leaguing themselves
with the devil, or something as discreditable. It was
enough for grown-up men with wives and families to ask for
such things as higher wages and more considerate treatment,
but when infants in the service followed such a bad example
it was time to nip such juvenile ambitions in the bud.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
Possibly this little postal Bumble, dressed in brief authority,
who thus undertook to protect the department from the predatory
designs of these youngsters, fancied that a higher wage
might demoralise them, or tempt them to marry too early.
A number of these poor little Oliver Twists were admitted
to examination singly, and some were so frightened at the
enormity of the offence of asking for more that they timidly
confessed on the spot that their humble petition had actually
been indited by a grown-up sorter named Jacobs. The
self-important little official gasped with astonishment, and
prepared to reach for his official club. The delinquent,
Jacobs—“Gentleman Jacobs” was his sobriquet among the
force—was peremptorily sent for, and an immediate written
explanation demanded of him as to why he did, on a certain
date, in direct contravention of printed Rule No. 01565,
incite and encourage these junior officers of her Majesty’s
postal service to dissatisfaction in regard to their prospects
and pay. Jacobs did as requested, justifying himself on three
sheets of foolscap. It was not the incriminating “explanation”
the official wanted. Jacobs flatly refused to state anything
but the truth about the matter. If the over-zealous
little official committed the folly of sending the case to the
authorities, nothing came of it.</p>

<p>The trifling incident is mentioned only to show how subordinate
officials with exaggerated notions of their duties may
sometimes earn for the authorities even more criticism among
the rank and file than they merit. The boy sorters afterwards
were given twelve shillings a week, which was a little
more in accordance with their value to the department. The
treatment of the boy sorters reflected but little credit on those
who were responsible. Those who were not harried out of
the service after enduring its hardships for six months or so
frequently survived only to become premature wrecks, eventually
disqualified by the Medical Branch. Lads fresh from
the country entering with high expectations, and it might be
said almost lured into the service under false pretences, often
fell early victims to consumption through their having to provide
for themselves on their meagre wage. In too many cases
insufficient food, the vitiated atmosphere of the sorting-office,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
the unnatural hours of duty, the bullying and the nerve-strain
put on them all told, and even left their traces on them in after
years. It was not to be wondered at that so many of those
who had been boy sorters were almost as soon as they reached
early manhood claimed by the White Death, consumption.</p>

<p>It was not long before this principle of cheap labour was
further extended, and the existing sorting force threatened to
be swamped by young recruits fresh from the ranks of the
telegraph messengers or from school. Doubtless it was partly
owing to this as well as to the bitter experience of the cruel
dismissals that the men of the sorting force continued to bear
their grievances in silence. From that time forward there had
been a period of stagnation; the grumblings of discontent
were reduced to a discreet whisper, and anything of the shape
of agitation was now discredited. The sorters had not easily
forgotten the sharp lesson that had been taught them, the risk
they had undergone, and the ordeal through which they had
passed. They knew they were now reduced by that defeat
to the condition of serfs, that they were slowly being deprived
of every right and privilege which goes to make the proud
boast of an Englishman. It was either submitting to this or
risking, almost with the certainty of further defeat, the bread
and butter of their wives and little ones. The department
had scored; but it had not entirely scotched the serpent of
discontent. If the silence and inactivity of the men were
thought to indicate contentment and a cheerful acceptance of
the situation, the authorities were mistaken. Nowhere but in
a Government department, either in England or Russia, could
such a state of things exist. In no English workshop, where
men had a trade in their hands and a kit of tools to call their
own, would they have submitted for so long to the treatment
meted out to them. For some considerable time after the
dismissals, the remainder of the force were treated like would-be
recalcitrants on whom it was necessary to keep a sharp eye,
and on whom it was as necessary to inflict humiliation for
their own good. Their convenience in the matter of sudden
compulsory summonses for extra duty was entirely ignored,
while the pay for such extra duty was unfair in the extreme.
Commonly at the behest of a minor official they were compelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
to stay beyond their legitimate time without any pay
whatever. The growing intolerance of the smaller authorities
towards the force gave encouragement to the minor superiors
to exercise to the full their proclivity for bullying and browbeating
the men on the smallest pretext. And the boy sorters
themselves met with the least consideration of all. Being
the juniors they were made to bear a more than proportionate
share of the hardships of their elders. Scores of them left
after a few months of it; and as many more had their dismissals
procured by the merest whim of an overseer, or the
caprice of a tyrannical inspector. The boy sorters had proved
very handy to the department, both as a foil to the possibility
of further agitation among the men and as an economical
experiment; but they despised them; or if they did not actually
despise them they allowed others to, and were utterly
indifferent to the manner of their treatment. The majority
of these lads were of an age too tender to be withdrawn safely
from the influence of the home circle; yet many of them had
only their bare wage of twelve shillings a week to enable them
to lodge, clothe, feed, and keep themselves honest upon.
They were of an age when the growing lad has all the appetites
of the man, yet the authorities did not think it unfair to
expect them to keep up a certain amount of respectability of
appearance. The chance of supplementing their income was
that of a compulsory summons in the middle of the night, or
rather four o’clock in the morning, and from this hour till nine
o’clock, five hours in all, performed before their actual day’s
duty commenced; they were remunerated with one shilling,
paid the following week. Whatever excuse was to be made
for the East-End sweater, openly and professedly exploiting
juvenile labour, there was none such to be made for a Government
department like the Post-Office.</p>

<p>So indifferent to the barest claims of humanity had the
officials calling themselves the authorities now become that
the men could barely call their souls their own. If they were
allowed an ownership over their spiritual being, that was
only to suit theoretical requirements, but in actual fact their
personal liberty was more circumscribed than ever. They had
always to remember that they were postal officials first, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
men and husbands and fathers afterwards. Away from the
office or otherwise they were to regard themselves as still on
duty, at least when off duty they were to hold themselves
always in readiness to respond to a telegram summoning them
to the office; consequently they must never make appointments,
except at their own risk. A man failing to respond to
the call of extra duty was not only set down as a shirker and
one unwilling to serve the department in an emergency, but
he was very often punished and insulted into the bargain.
Superintendents and the “heads of departments” in those
days particularly were allowed unchecked to give fullest vent
to their own personal predilections, their own particular likes
and dislikes, and if it was that they were not allowed a larger
discretion than in these days, it was mostly due to the fact
that the men had no means of resenting such barefaced
assertions of autocracy. While the men bore it without a
combined protest, a superintendent of a branch might, if he
chose, become a little despot, with the power to render
miserable the hundreds of men under his control. For as is
the master so are his stewards and bailiffs. The example set by
one higher official is eagerly imitated by his immediate subordinates,
and those over whom they have control are the sufferers.</p>

<p>That the apathy of the force in respect to combination for
mutual interest was taken advantage of by their immediate
superiors, was shown in many curious and significant ways.
Excuses for late attendance or for non-compliance with
regulation, which would be graciously accepted now, were
then often treated with open derision and contempt. A
superintendent might either call a man with a ready excuse
a downright liar to his face, or he might, in his desire to be
strictly official, display such an utter want of feeling as to be
guilty of conduct almost bordering on brutality. It was the
vogue of one official of this period to regulate everything
strictly according to rule. He thought himself too loyal
a servant of the department even to exercise that little
discretion vested in him by his superiors. Besides, he
thought it was saving himself a deal of trouble to do so,
and the muttered imprecations of the men or their hidden
scowls never entered into his calculations. He never deviated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
a hair’s-breadth from the rule laid down. If by an unhappy
mischance there had been a misprint in the rule-book or instructions
to postmasters and others, that a man found absenting
himself from the sorting-office for more than the usual
period, should be “hanged” instead of only “suspended,” he
would have made no inquiry. He would have taken it for
granted and had the poor wretch hanged from the gallery
forthwith in a coil of the red-tape so dear to his heart. He
was not the only one of his tribe. It was not that the higher
authorities either directly encouraged or were fully cognisant
of this sort of conduct on their part; if they did not know, they
did not want to know; these were trifles that did not concern
them. Such things have concerned them only when the men’s
murmurs rose to a pitch high enough to compel their attention.
The men had ceased for so long to murmur openly that perhaps
the authorities were not so much to blame for allowing
petty tyranny on the part of the smaller to go unchecked.</p>

<p>While the men remained unorganised amongst themselves,
the officials could see no wrong in putting fresh impositions
on those under their control. The old device of forcing the
men on extra duty, without pay or return of any kind, was
more freely resorted to than ever. The eight hours’ day remained
virtually unrecognised, and those who had attended at
four or half-past four in the early morning were more often than
not imprisoned like galley-slaves at the sorting-tables an hour,
sometimes two hours, beyond the time when they should have
been free to go home to obtain rest, and prepare once more
for the afternoon’s duty.</p>

<p>The officials profited little by the experience of that occasion
a year or so previous when the men, goaded beyond the
limits of forbearance, took the law into their own hands and
boldly broke through the imprisoning doors, and asserted their
liberty as free men in a free country. These disgraceful rushes
for liberty—disgraceful only on the part of the authorities, who
sought to imprison them like convicts, forgetful that they were
public servants in the service of the most freedom-loving
country in the world—were several times repeated. And the
men who dared to protest in this primitive fashion, which was
now the only one left to them, were as frequently threatened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
and punished. The officials apparently thought that by
singling out a few individuals here and there they would
terrorise the rest into an acceptance of this unjust system of
forced and compulsory labour without pay, and bolster up
their own authority. Whatever extra duty that was paid for
was paid for on the lowest scale possible, and, coupled with
that, was in most cases rendered compulsory between most
inconvenient hours, so as to deprive the men of either rest or
recreation. After completing the half of their day’s work they
would find themselves, perhaps on their arrival home, suddenly
summoned back on duty right in the middle of the day, between
10 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span> and 2 <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span> This, it will be seen, meant a serious
loss of time to them, as they were on duty again at 4.30 <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span>,
and for all this they were rewarded with nothing better than
payment equal to the “docker’s tanner”—sixpence per hour.</p>

<p>There were two or three abortive attempts at rebellion
against this cruel system, but protests were vain in convincing
the authorities of its hardship or unfairness. The old official
dictum that the permanence of their employment as Government
servants amply compensated for every shortcoming, continually
weighed with the authorities, and was as continually
advanced against the claims of the men. Because the department
had vouchsafed to them something like permanence of
employment, it took to itself the right of imposing any conditions
the caprice of its officials might devise, and of abrogating
their menials’ privileges whenever they thought proper. Men
who failed from whatever cause to respond promptly to these
domiciliary summonses were severely reprimanded, and their
conduct held in remembrance for use against them in the
future. Moreover, in answer to the respectful complaint that
sixpence an hour was a too unfair remuneration for those at
the maximum of their class, it was pointed out that there was
no Treasury grant sufficient to entitle them to more. But it
is significant that on one occasion when the sorters at last
showed a more determined front than usual by disregarding a
peremptory summons of this nature, almost to a man excusing
themselves on the ground that the pay was far too little, eightpence
an hour was granted the following week; and the men
wondered all the more, as the smallest Treasury grant generally
took more time than the proverbial mountain in labour.</p>

<p>A PERIOD OF STAGNATION—THE BLIND POSTMASTER-GENERAL
AND A GLEAM OF LIGHT—A MEMORABLE VISIT—THE
FAWCETT SCHEME.</p>

</div>

<p>Lord John Manners had descended from his pedestal of
office and returned to the comparative obscurity and inactivity
for which his attainments so well fitted him. Before
leaving the Post-Office he had the satisfaction of knowing
that, from one point of view, he had done at least one
thing well; he had stifled discontent and reduced the common
herd of postal workers to their proper level of uncomplaining
Government serfs. Under his régime had grown and flourished
naturally a system of petty tyranny and sycophancy which
rendered open honest protest well-nigh impossible, which compelled
men to endure it or accept the alternative, resignation
or dismissal, and which made any attempt at combination as
impossible as in the prehistoric days before the penny post.
The condition, so far as the limitations on their liberty were
concerned, was every whit as bad as prevailed years before the
agitation. Nearly all the reforms which the late agitation had
started so hopefully to attain had been left undone. The violent
<i lang="fr">coup</i> for which Lord John Manners was responsible had taken
the heart out of the men, and they had to take the postal service
as they found it or leave it for others to be forced into
their places from the stress of competition outside. The hide-bound
official tenet that the permanency of Government employment
more than compensated for all shortcomings was
now being interpreted as if to mean that this quality of
“permanency” not only compensated for but justified and
rendered necessary the employment of petty persecution, the
deprivation of almost every claim to citizenship, and the curtailment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
of most ordinary human rights. The utter contempt
of the officials for men’s common rights and privileges as
human beings, their churlish indifference to the common
claims of manhood, have to some extent already been shown.
Even the “permanency” of employment was commonly
nullified on the smallest pretext, and seniority and long faithful
service counted for little against the whim of a tyrannical
supervisor. If it was creditable to the public service to have it
manned by those who suffered from grievances yet dared not
complain of them; if it was profitable to the Treasury to have
the rank and file of the postal service remain underpaid and
forced labour exacted from them; if it was requisite that the
woes of the men should be hidden alike from the public and
from the higher permanent officials henceforth, most of the
credit, most of the honour, was due to Lord John Manners.
If it was well that all inquiry should be stifled and the men be
kept in servile subjection by superiors whose common conception
of their duties was that of Russian jailers; if it was
necessary in the course of proper discipline that men should
be treated as though they had no soul to call their own, Lord
John Manners, by the one act by which he achieved this
success, deserved the gratitude of his country.</p>

<p>Thus it will be seen that nearly everything which the agitation
had set out to do, all the reforms which it had promised,
were left for a future generation. A long period of stagnation
had set in, and but for the faint echo of agitation occasionally
coming from the telegraphists, the Post-Office, so far as
uttered discontent was concerned, might have been wrapped
in slumber.</p>

<p>Lord John Manners had departed for good, unwept, unhonoured,
and unsung. His advent and departure had
witnessed no change in the conditions of the service. Time
in the Post-Office dragged its slow weary length along
till the year 1881 was reached. That year was to witness a
glad surprise for the dejected sorting staff at least. If Lord
John Manners was the one man who was to be bitterly
remembered as having battened down the hatches on the
galley-slaves, set a seal on their freedom of action, and put a
premium on official exaction, Professor Henry Fawcett was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
one who came at last to offer them a fuller share of air and
liberty. Lord John Manners, belonging to the political party
which had encouraged their demands, and, in the persons of
some of its most prominent men, almost, it might be said,
aided and abetted the agitation, so far from carrying out the
reforms which had been confidently expected of him, had
discouraged their aspirations by means of a whip of scorpions.
They had asked for bread, and he had given them something
worse than a stone. Professor Henry Fawcett had scarcely
been approached, certainly not by those who figured in the
late agitation, yet remembering his promises of bygone years,
and with a generous desire to meet the necessities of their
case, he of his own free will, and almost spontaneously, offered
reparation for the long disappointment they had sustained.
Mr. Fawcett, though never taking a prominent part, or figuring
too largely in the letter-carriers’ and sorters’ three years’ agitation,
yet had associated himself with it to an extent, often
giving his wise counsel to Booth and the others, and always his
sympathy and best wishes for bettering the conditions of the
service. He showed that he was not likely to forget now.</p>

<p>Discontent among the telegraphists had reached a somewhat
acute stage, and the new Postmaster-General busied himself
for some time in arriving at the inner facts of their case. He
rose from his study of the telegraphists’ troubles with a conviction
that something must be done to meet the justice of
their demands. It was not clamour that weighed with him, but
a genuine inclination to do the right thing so far as in him
lay, and to put in order the household which his predecessors
had more or less neglected. He had the fullest desire to mete
out justice to the telegraphists, but there was the sister branch
of the service to be considered likewise. That portion of the
Augean stable was, if anything, in a worse condition, and he
decided to ascertain for himself.</p>

<p>One evening, in his quiet simple manner, the blind Postmaster-General
presented himself at the General Post-Office
unannounced and asked to be taken over the sorting department,
and to have things explained to him. The scene was
one of bustle and confusion; and the dull roar and the clank
of stamping machinery, and the movements of hundreds of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
men in a confined space, filled the overburdened air. He
was conducted to a position on the gallery overlooking the
busy, crowded Letter Branch, which to ordinary eyes resembled
nothing so much as an overturned ant-hill. Mr. Fawcett’s
form and features were not familiar to the majority; but presently
the whisper went round that the tall, silent man, seeming
to stare down upon them through the big black spectacles
which hid his closed eyes, was the Postmaster-General himself.
For a few moments strict discipline was forgotten in curiosity,
and few could really believe that one who could so intently
follow the movements of the throbbing machinery below, as
he did, could be wholly blind. They did not comprehend to
the full the pathos of it; they did not know that this was only
a habit he had schooled himself into to hide his infirmity.
Nor did they know that in him they looked on the first Postmaster-General
who had come among them with an honest
desire to prove their benefactor. It chanced—or it may have
been that Mr. Fawcett himself preferred it—that a young
junior sorter was deputed to take him over the building. The
young man acting as guide succeeded in so interesting him by
his manner of describing all that the blind eyes could not see
that at last Professor Fawcett asked him his position in the
service, and further questioned him as to his pay and prospects.
Presumably from what he gathered on that occasion he learnt
much that set him thinking. A little while afterwards an
official circular announced that the Postmaster-General would
be willing to receive a statement of the men’s claims to better
pay and prospects.</p>

<p>The issue of such a circular was as unexpected as manna
from heaven. It was some days before the letter-sorters could
realise their good fortune in having a Daniel come to judgment
at last after all their privations. Although the circular
was a guarantee of good faith on the part of the Postmaster-General,
the men still betrayed a certain amount of timidity in
responding to so generous an invitation, until four or five of
them, forming themselves into a provisional committee, called
a meeting in one of the kitchens, and the basis of a plan was
laid down. There were several such meetings with the sanction
of the authorities, who could not decently withhold it;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
there was much cackling before the egg was finally laid, as
there usually is. But at last a petition to the Postmaster-General
was formulated and sent on its mission. The claims
set forth were studiously modest, and comprised a request
to rise to fifty shillings a week by yearly increments of two
shillings instead of eighteenpence, and a yearly holiday extended
to three weeks instead of only a fortnight, and an
improved scale of pay for extra duty. This constituted the
whole of the demand for the sorters.</p>

<p>Mr. Fawcett lost no time in doing what he considered the
right thing, and in endeavouring to apply a remedy for all the
discontent which had for so long prevailed. He went about
constructing his remedial measure in a masterly manner and
broad-minded spirit. It might have been expected that he, a
professor of the “dismal science,” would have sought for a
ready means to evade the importunities of a discontented
service. But not so; he broadly recognised that discontent
was a symptom, a symptom of a growing polypus beneath the
surface, and he sought for a means to eradicate the cause.
He apparently spared himself no pains to arrive at the true
facts of the situation. The report which he made to the
Lords of the Treasury signified much inquiry and many hours
of labour. He wrote: “For several months past I have
been collecting information from all sources, not only as to
the alleged grievances of the staff, but as to the conditions of
service and rates of pay of persons in private employment,
whose duties seem most nearly to correspond to theirs.”</p>

<p>Here in these few words is told a story of diligence, patient
research, and laborious study—all the more wonderful for a
sightless man—which it would take a complete volume to
adequately accord full justice to. The consideration of this
alone should extenuate whatever few shortcomings might be
found in his remedial measure, which came to be known as
the “Fawcett Scheme.” Such faults, such as they were, were
but as the black specks on the white ermine, perhaps the
more accentuating the real goodness of his intention.</p>

<p>In response to his solicitations, the Lords of the Treasury
accepted his proposals for a revised scale of pay for telegraphists
and “sorting clerks,” and on the 13th of June 1881<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
the scheme was issued. It dealt with the principal complaints
from the two branches of the service, the telegraphic and the
postal; and referred specifically to inadequacy of pay, arising
from stagnation of promotion, the excessive amount of overtime,
the small rate of pay allowed for it, and the severity of
night duty; the insufficiency of yearly holiday; and a readjustment
of pay for work performed on Christmas Day and Good
Friday. The scheme apparently intended was to apply to
telegraphists and sorters pretty equally, and altogether, if
nothing more can be said of it, it was a bold attempt, and
the bolder because it was the first attempt of the kind, to
bring order out of chaos, to unite in some manner the tangled
and disconnected threads of a complex and perplexing problem.
It was practically the first attempt to solve a problem
teeming with petty jealousies and sectional discontents; a
patient attempt to skilfully untie the Gordian knot, which
Lord John Manners had only rudely hacked at with the knife
of official despotism. It was an honest attempt to fulfil his
obligations to a distressed and justly-discontented service with
which years before taking office he had professed a sympathy.
With him it was the accomplishment of a duty; and it was as
such that he laid his proposals before the Lords of the Treasury.
It was a forward step in the right direction which ought
to have been taken long before it was. Instead of attempting
to suppress discontent in the same fashion as his predecessor,
he gave to postal servants their first charter of liberty. It was
not complete; it was not made to fit the full demands of the
case perhaps; few first charters are; but without it, further
extensions of postal liberty would scarcely have been possible.
If it was only a gleam of light in the darkness, and the beginning
of a process of development, where only stagnation had
prevailed, it was something; and honour was due to its author
for his rare courage.</p>

<p>By the Fawcett scheme the letter-sorters found their position
materially improved. They who had dropped agitation, who
had been reduced to a condition of timorous servility almost,
who had scarcely dared to ask for what they were invited to
take, found themselves nearly as well off as those who had
fancied themselves entitled to far greater benefits. Everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
that the sorters through years of vain agitation had sought to
obtain it seemed was now to be granted. The claim to rise to
fifty shillings a week, for the asking of which some time before
five of their number had been dismissed, was now given them
without demur. And what was more, the scheme was dated
back to the preceding April, so that some immediate monetary
benefit accrued to the majority. In addition to the increases
in wages there was to be payment for sacred holidays; a
revised system of payment for overtime; the recommendation
being that extra duty be paid for strictly in proportion to the
amount of weekly wages received; while there were certain
other minor advantages, including one which minimised the
severity of night attendance. It is unnecessary here to give
the whole measure in detail; but such, broadly, were the
advantages apparently vouchsafed to the sorting force, the
defeat of whose legitimate aims by a former Postmaster-General,
and whose rejection had reduced them to a condition
of hopeless apathy. The glad surprise, then, with which they
especially received the Fawcett scheme may be still imagined.</p>

<p>Yet Mr. Fawcett’s generous attempt to apply a panacea for
postal discontent was to some extent doomed to fall short of
the effect intended, and this from little fault of his own.</p>

<p>The just intention that animated Mr. Fawcett in his recommendations
was shown by his actually offering, in one case at
least, more than was demanded of him, and more than he was
compelled to give in any instance. True, his liberality in this
respect extended to only one section of the service—the London
sorting force; but the fact remains that he might easily
have withheld all that he so freely gave. Had he been less
liberal-minded, he might, with as much excuse and with as
much success probably, have adopted the uncompromising
attitude of every predecessor in office. Whatever compelling
influence there might have been which resulted in the Fawcett
scheme proceeded from the telegraphists’ agitation of that
period, though it is more natural to believe that Mr. Fawcett
acted throughout independently, and was moved from purely
just and liberal motives.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, however, it must be said, though there is
excuse in abundance, that his good intention was hardly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
balanced by a due sense of proportion. That was the principal
internal fault of the scheme. While it naturally satisfied
the sorters for the time, it brought little more than disappointment
to the telegraphists, who expected so much more than
was apportioned them. It left the postmen and the auxiliary
postmen just where they were before in point of pay, their only
share being a prospect of partaking of the minor advantages,
such as payment for overtime and sacred days, which presumably
were now to be enjoyed in common by all classes. A
measure which, by its fault of disproportion, must inevitably
engender the jealousy of the less favoured against their comrades
in the service, could not be regarded as a final settlement.
It was successful only to an extent as a temporary
solution of an existing difficulty, but not as the ultimate settlement
for all time of a troublesome problem. Probably its
author would have claimed no more for it than this; but even
on these grounds it might have gone further. That this scheme,
costing the country as it did £152,000 per annum, and affecting
ten thousand servants, was not made to go further, so as to
bring some measure of material benefit to the postmen and
auxiliaries and others, was to be regretted. Doubtless Mr.
Fawcett felt that he had gone far enough in recommending
benefits involving such a reduction on the yearly profits of the
Post-Office; but a little closer consideration of the conditions
of the letter-carrier class at that time might have averted the
trouble among them which arose later on. There is this, however,
to be said in extenuation of its shortcomings in respect
to the letter-carriers. They either did not take Mr. Fawcett’s
invitation to state their grievances as seriously addressed to
themselves, or, from some misunderstanding, their case was
not put as fully and as convincingly as it might. The Postmaster-General
therefore possibly felt justified in thinking that
the letter-carriers were more or less satisfied with their position
and prospects, and he was not induced to go out of his way
on their behalf. With the letter-sorters the matter was rather
different; they had responded, even if none too vigorously, with
the result, as has been shown, that the five shillings taken off
their weekly wage some years before by Lord John Manners
was now restored to them. That was the single advantage by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
which they scored over the letter-carriers. The strength and
the justice of the Fawcett scheme lay principally in the fact
that new privileges were to be enjoyed in common; that at
least every man in the Post-Office could claim payment for
Christmas Day and Good Friday; and that payment for extra
duty was adjusted in fair proportion to his salary. These were
in themselves no inconsiderable advantages, which were worth
being thankful for.</p>

<p>Such, at least, they would have been, only that the unfortunate
fact remained that most of these advantages for
some unexplained reason were for long withheld by the
authorities who administered the scheme. The advantages
and benefits intended for the sorting force were precisely and
definitely laid down; but the department, either thinking that
the force did not merit justice in such full doses, or from some
mistaken conception as to the spirit and letter of Mr. Fawcett’s
measure, did not give them the full benefit of it there and
then. Indeed, it even came to be contended that the Fawcett
scheme was never meant to apply to the London postal staff.
The men had been taught to be grateful for small mercies.
They had been willing to open their mouth and shut their
eyes, inspired by the new hope of getting something, just as
they had prepared themselves never more to expect anything
else than to live and die in the service, discontented and ill-treated
to the last. The generous offer of an immediate small
monetary benefit overwhelmed them. They were in the
position of the pauper coming in for a windfall who is content
so long as he gets only a portion, reserving till later his
inquiries as to the peculations of others and the extent to
which he has been robbed by the good kind guardians meanwhile.
It is sufficient to say that very little of the advantages
set forth in the scheme, which was said to cost so much, was
interpreted to apply to them. In the matter of payment for
extra duty even they found themselves no better off, while
every other expectation that the scheme had raised slowly
dwindled at last into a vague sense of disappointment and a
loss of faith in the justice of the Post-Office stewards. Resentment
did not come until the actual discovery later on that
they had been cheated out of Mr. Fawcett’s good intention.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
It was not till the blind Postmaster-General was still and
voiceless in the quietude of the grave that the suspicion took
definite shape that some of his principal benefits had been so
long withheld from them. It was that discovery and that
conviction which furnished the real primary reason for the
starting of a further great agitation in a few years’ time. It
is only necessary, however, to refer to this in passing; that
forms a portion of the narrative to be told presently. The
scheme therefore failed in its effect through being applied only
in a too niggardly fashion by those who administered it. It
was made to fail mainly because of that; but its failure was
partly due to its own internal defects.</p>

<p>One fault of the Fawcett scheme—one which was not discovered
until some long time afterwards, but which was
destined to prove the source of further trouble—was its
ambiguity in several of its terms as applied to the “sorting
clerks” and “sorters.” On the face of it the textual phrasing
of the scheme was clear and precise enough, and there is no
reason to doubt that both Mr. Fawcett and the Lords of the
Treasury meant to be perfectly and honestly unambiguous.
Yet owing, it may be supposed, to the lack of efficient
organisation among those whom it most benefited, the full
value of the measure was not so fully examined as it might
have been. The sorters especially were only too glad to
receive without criticism, and without looking such an unexpected
gift-horse in the mouth, any remedy for their present
grievances. And so the letter-sorting staff ate the lotus leaf
of contentment, and for a long time were too busy with self-congratulation
to have any suspicion of the doubt which was
to by-and-by arise as to whether they were enjoying all that
they were entitled to by the textual warrant and by the
intention of their benefactor. The manner of its application
and its interpretation by the officials was never questioned,
therefore, until several years later, when the expansion of the
service and the growing requirements of the force made it
only too evident that the Fawcett scheme, conceived and
inspired though it was in the most generous spirit, was
impossible of adaptation for all time.</p>

<p>That the London sorters were identical with the “sorting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
clerks” alluded to specifically in the scheme the sorters themselves
had little doubt, while they had a vague impression that
they were now given something nearly approaching to equality
with the telegraphists. But they were not induced to inquire
further, or to examine the terms of their bond more closely
yet awhile. This was not the result of their apathy so much,
however, as their want of knowledge about the scheme itself.
A notion prevailed that the printed scheme was something
forbidden to the minor officials, and as unobtainable as the
sibylline books. In fact, it was not till fully eight years later
that it came to be discovered that it could be obtained in
the ordinary way as a Parliamentary publication. It was
reserved till 1889 to definitely inquire for themselves whether
they had or had not received the full benefits secured to them
under its provisions. And even then it seemed that the
dead benefactor was to be robbed of the credit and the honour
that were due to him. In fact, as will be learnt, little less
than an insult was to be offered to the memory of the dead
statesman.</p>

<p>BEGINNINGS OF THE TELEGRAPHISTS’ MOVEMENT—AN EARLY
ATTEMPT AT A STRIKE—A <i lang="fr">COUP D’ÉTAT</i>—“SCUDAMORE’S
FOLLY.”</p>

</div>

<p>At this point it is necessary to go back a number of years to
gather in a trailing strand that has yet to be spliced into the
body of the narrative. As has already been noted, the spirit
of discontent and agitation in the Post-Office had strongly
manifested itself in various ways before the year 1870. For
nearly twenty-five years trouble in the postal ranks had shown
itself from time to time. And the taking over of the telegraphs
by the Government, and placing the old companies’ staffs
under the wing of the Post-Office, was to recruit new forces
for the army of discontent. If the men thus taken over had
had a little more consideration shown them from the outset,
perhaps much of the future trouble which from the first
moment was set brewing might have been arrested. But it
was not so, despite the promises held out to them, and it was
not long before they realised that they were to remain a
neglected body.</p>

<p>Before the transfer the telegraph business of the country
was divided amongst three principal companies, “The Electric,”
“The United Kingdom,” “The British, Irish, and
Magnetic,” and, for London only, “The Metropolitan District
Company.” They had no connection with each other, but it
seems that the men in their employ indifferently rambled from
one to the other on the mere strength of having been formerly
employed anywhere as a telegraphist. The class of men for
the most part so employed was a very mixed one, and consisted
largely of those who had “come down in the world,”
often men of birth and education, and those shipwrecked from
other vessels. They seemed to be an independent, Bohemian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
lot, and somewhat nomadic in their habits, for not infrequently
those dismissed or resigned from one company, with little
difficulty took a seat in another of the three. The conditions
were much about the same, and the salary equally poor,
averaging about £1 a week. But though the salary was low,
and the prospects ill defined and unsatisfactory, it was understood
that there were other means of making money in a small
way. There was apparently a looseness and a happy-go-lucky
style of freedom obtaining among the telegraph companies of
this period that enabled the operators to make for themselves
certain privileges which ultimately became their rights. Their
salary was low, but in course of time it was to some extent
compensated for by the acquisition of perquisites, and small
emoluments. These often consisted of keeping the offices
open after hours, and making their own charges, levying taxes
for porterage on messages, taking allowances for string, paper,
and other material. In some cases these privileges and
emoluments accruing to the senior men were farmed out
among the juniors to save time and trouble. A company’s
operator might occasionally constitute himself a temporary
agent for his company in his spare time after ordinary hours
of duty, charging sixpence extra on each message, and this the
companies rather encouraged than otherwise. The men were
on free and easy terms with most of the business men in their
locality, and presents and Christmas-boxes of a substantial
nature often came to them in the form of provisions, &amp;c., in
recognition of services rendered in emergency. There was
generally a telegraph office at the more important railway
stations throughout the kingdom, and the railway officials
commonly extended privileges to the telegraph companies’
operators. Railway fares were scarcely taken into account in
the cost of living, and a telegraph operator attached to a telegraph
office on any company’s line experienced little difficulty
in obtaining a free pass for almost any distance.</p>

<p>Such a precarious system of remuneration for their services
was almost as unsatisfactory for them as it proved to be for
the telegraph-using public; and it is doubtful if such a state
of things could have lasted much longer when the requirements
of the service broadened and developed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>When it became known in 1868, through the passing of the
Telegraph Act in that year, that the companies and the men
together were to be swept into the Post-Office, it was very
naturally expected that there would be some improvement
in their prospects, even if no immediate benefit were offered
them. The men, therefore, in anticipation that their future
under Government service would be somewhat improved, put
themselves on their best behaviour, and stiffened themselves
up a little more.</p>

<p>As was only to be expected among such an independent
body of men, who, through all their career in the service of
the old companies, had been allowed much liberty and discretion
and those few privileges only possible in their employ,
dissatisfaction soon followed on disappointment, when it was
learnt that, after all, nothing was to be gained from the
transfer. High hopes had been entertained by the telegraph
clerks by the occurrence of one passage in the 1868 Act,
to which great weight and importance had been attached.
The clause read: “Such Officers and Clerks upon their
appointment shall be deemed to be, to all intents and purposes,
Officers and Clerks in the Permanent Civil Service of
the Crown, and shall be entitled to the same but no other
privileges.”</p>

<p>Instead of which, while there was no improvement in salary,
all the little privileges and chances of emoluments were of
necessity withdrawn. They were subjected to a far more
rigorous rule of discipline than they had in their free-born
manner been accustomed to in their former employment.
In the old companies many averaged £2 a week at least,
though there was no fixed rate of salary; but when the
Government took them under its paternal care, there was no
consideration made for what they had lost or left behind.
The companies had been bought over lock, stock, and barrel,
and the human machines, despised but indispensable, were
thrown in as chattels and makeweight. The estates had been
bought, and with them the serfs living on the land; and,
being useful only to make the estates pay, they were, in the
usual logic of the circumstances, least considered. The average
wage was only 17s. or 18s. a week; there were no meal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
reliefs for provincial men; there was compulsory excessive
overtime, in some cases for nothing, and in most cases next
to nothing.</p>

<p>They saw that if they were to obtain better treatment and
fairer prospects, as befitted their new character as Government
servants, they would have to fight for it. This they
commenced doing by means of petition. But these petitions
were either ignored or refused, and not the slightest concession
was made. The compulsion to bring up their starvation
pittance to a normal wage by an excessive amount of overtime,
poorly paid for—often no more than threepence an hour—with
also excessive punishment by the imposition of extra duty,
without pay, for the most trifling errors, soon proved that they
had jumped out of the frying-pan into the fire. While the
telegraph service was divided among a number of private
companies, and while the telegraph clerks remained a limited
class, they could play on the rivalry among the companies,
and had things pretty much their own way when a grievance
oppressed them. But under the new conditions of service
they found that on the score of their serving the Crown
instead of a private concern, they were expected to accept
conditions and treatment which would not have been tolerated
for a month under the old system. The eight hours’ day was
reduced to a mere farce by the compulsion to earn anything
approaching a decent livelihood only by means of miserably-paid
overtime. They found that they were expected to pay
dearly for the honour of serving a Government monopoly, and
that, moreover, they were at the mercy of the department
because it was a monopoly. Their hopes and expectations,
based on the explicitly-worded clause in the Telegraph Act of
1868, were almost from the first moment of their entrance
through the portals of the Post-Office dashed to the ground.
They saw that the public and themselves had been hoodwinked
by the specious promises held out to the old companies’
servants. They therefore decided to put the public in full
possession of the facts of their case; and if they could not
obtain redress from the department which had so far betrayed
their confidence, they would revert to other and more drastic
means. The old companies’ men were not so tame and submissive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
as perhaps the authorities had anticipated. They
regarded the clause in the Telegraph Act as undoubtedly
covering themselves, and at least, if it did not entitle them
to being placed on an equality with the lower or second division
of the Civil Service—upon which they maintained the
framers of the Act intended them to be placed—they should
be accorded better treatment in minor respects.</p>

<p>The scant hospitality the new comers had received at the
hands of the authorities for months rankled deeply within
them. They found that they had been delivered into the
house of bondage; and Mr. Frank Ives Scudamore, and the
others of the authorities who wore their honours so thick upon
them for effecting the transfer of the mighty business, were
hard and inconsiderate taskmasters where their humbler servants
were concerned. The disappointment increased with
the realisation that the department repudiated its promise and
its obligations as contained in the Act, and the mutterings of
discontent swelled in volume.</p>

<p>The first attempt at organisation for redress was made in
1871, the year following the transfer. If they came in like
lambs, they preferred to go out, if they went out at all, like
roaring lions. During the few months they had been in the
employ of their new masters the thousands of company men
had found a ready means of intercommunication and an exchange
of news and ideas. Men became familiarised with
each other from a distance all over the country, and the
electric current of discontent ran freely along the wires from
every large centre. In every large office throughout the kingdom
there were eager spirits waiting for the opportunity to do
something towards promoting the agitation and establishing a
common line of action. They had the very instrument in
their hands which most favoured their desire and their plans.
The mine was laid; it wanted but the electric spark of a
united purpose to fire the train. Exactly how the mine was
prepared and sprung perhaps will never be definitely known.
It was communicated from several of the large towns that
the aggrieved men were animated with a single purpose and
desire; each did their share in the way of convening meetings
among the staff, in making collections for a general fund, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
giving mutual help and encouragement. As is always the case,
the leaders came forward as the occasion demanded it; but it
is somewhat difficult to assign the authorship of this first movement
to any particular individual. The agitation was less the
result of any personality or quality of leadership than it was
the spontaneous response to a widely-spread sense of injustice.
One curious result of the unanimity of feeling, and the spontaneity
of its translation into action, was that almost every
town in turn afterwards claimed to have taken the initiative,
and to have produced the arch agitator who originated the
movement. At this time of day the claim of Manchester is
almost universally allowed. Manchester from the first moment
uprose as a mountain of discontent; it produced both men
and money for the agitation, and became the seat of the
memorable strike. But for long afterwards, before the fragments
came to be pieced together into historic orderliness,
and while the discussion which always succeeds the battle was
proceeding among the late participants, it was contended that
Bradford had an almost equal claim. There was one man at
Bradford office, a counterman, a man of superior attainments,
a gentleman by birth and education, who, realising the situation,
conceived the possibility of a universal agitation among
telegraphists, if not all postal servants who had wrongs to be
righted and grievances to be redressed. He was not the only
one who shared this dream at that time; and possibly, had
it come a couple of years later, when the postmen’s agitation
was in full swing, it might have been realised to an extent
which would have proved even more embarrassing to the
Government than it did. Ashden was the name of the Bradford
man, whose ambition was equal to his discontent, and
with a courage that outweighed both. He thought it necessary
to complete the organisation without delay, and to this end
at once threw himself into the fray, and tacitly assumed the
leadership of the Bradford contingent. There was a series of
the usual back-stair meetings, and others more or less secret,
but a meeting on a more pretentious scale was held outside
the town at a place called Smithy’s Bridge. This was an
exclusive if not altogether private gathering, only a chosen
dozen or so being present. It was in reality a conference of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
the powers, for it consisted principally of delegates from the
centres of disaffection and the prominent agitators of those
places, including Mulholland and Hacker of Manchester, and
Norman of Liverpool. They met to decide on some common
plan of action in response to the desire on every hand. It was
shortly after the meeting at Bradford that the Telegraphists’
Organisation was formally founded.</p>

<p>In the meantime, however, the same discontent begotten of
irritation and disappointment at the manner of their modest
claims being ignored found a voice at Liverpool, Manchester,
Edinburgh, Dublin, and various other places. The decision
come to at Bradford was taken away to each of these centres
and there discussed and pondered over, and resulted in a small
conference at Manchester being held in a room at the Railway
Tavern, while a similar meeting was held at Liverpool
at the Clock Tavern, London Road. At each of these communions
Ashden made his influence felt and helped to mould
the plan of future action.</p>

<p>In due course, on October 21, 1871, a Telegraphists’ Association
was formed, Manchester being the head centre; and
from the moment of its inauguration three Manchester men,
T. W. Mulholland, Hollingworth, and Heald, were the acknowledged
leaders. Needless to say, the newly-formed association
found plenty of work to do from the very start.</p>

<p>The authorities, seemingly anticipating that there would
presently be trouble among the men, had made some preparations
for an emergency, and at the same time provided themselves
a means by which the old company men could be
discarded if they proved too importunate. In some of the
larger towns selected men were made “clerks in charge.”
Those who undertook the rotation were for the most part the
old companies’ transferred men and others who had been
engaged after the transfer, and who were beginning to smart
under the conviction that they had been enticed into the
service under false pretences. In their eagerness to put a foil
on the prevailing discontent the authorities took into the service
any one who had the barest and most rudimentary knowledge
of an instrument; the halt, the lame, and almost the
blind being also accepted. Though often of little use, these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
newly-imported men in some cases succeeded in getting higher
wages than the men who did the real work. Scores of old
companies’ men were getting but a pound a week or less,
while ex-pupil-teachers and others were brought in from the
streets and given twenty-five shillings. Such things could not
but produce still further friction, and it looked as if the preference
would be given to these men who were so unjustly set
off against them. In fact it soon proved so in some instances,
and a number of the younger of the companies’ men became
so disgusted that some joined foreign cable telegraph companies,
preferring to trust their future to private employers
than to a Government department which could treat them so.
Others went to America and were still better received. A
large number of the youngsters whose fathers or relations were
already in the Post-Office had been placed under tuition as
learners before the transfer, and these and the others, ex-schoolmasters,
&amp;c., were induced to take little or no part in
the drama.</p>

<p>It is significant that soon after the starting of the agitation,
Mr. Scudamore, the Permanent Under-Secretary, promised a
new scale of classification. This promise lulled the discontent
for a while; but the long-continued delay in bringing it out
brought the feeling to an acute stage. The men did not let
their mutterings go unheard.</p>

<p>The leaders of the Telegraphists’ Association now became
aware that all their communications to the various branches
of the movement were, both letters and telegrams, being
“Grahamed” or tapped, and it was more than believed that
the authorities were exercising a rigorous censorship over the
correspondence between members. To avoid this, messages
to other towns were frequently forwarded by train, and eventually
a secret code was arranged, the telegrams appertaining to
the business of the movement being addressed to a private
firm in Manchester. These telegrams referring to the arrangement
of meetings and other business were handed in and paid
for in the ordinary way over the counter, and, in the case
of Manchester, all were addressed to Doncaster &amp; Knowles,
75 Oxford Street, who, being in sympathy with the men, placed
their address at their disposal. The code which was adopted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
was varied from time to time and as events progressed. The
towns affected were referred to in these secret messages by
various Christian names: “John” was London, “James”
Manchester, “Charley” Birmingham, “Peter” Sheffield,
“Tom” Liverpool, “Ben” Bristol, and so on through the
whole list of towns. Numerals from one to nine were “tallow,”
“rape,” “olive,” “cotton,” “linseed,” “petroleum,” “currants,”
“molasses,” and “whisky.” When the strike agitation
was fully started the code was considerably amplified and rendered
more complicated for safety.</p>

<p>Meantime the prevailing discontent and the threatening
aspect of affairs did not escape the observation of the press
any more than of the authorities. A letter appeared in the
<cite>London Standard</cite> directing attention to the movement in
the provinces, and the imminence of a strike unless the
authorities took action speedily. A day or two after, on
the 7th December 1871, officials from the Chief Office were
sent down to Manchester to inquire into the condition of
things. The result of this official inquiry was the immediate
suspension of the leaders, Mulholland, Heald, Hacker,
Hollingworth, and others forming the committee, while the
same course was adopted at Liverpool and Bradford. The
men were suspended for fomenting agitation and for forming
an association in contravention of official regulation and the
Law of Conspiracy. Similar Star-Chamber inquiries were also
made at Liverpool the same day, with the result that one of
the Liverpool committee, C. Nottingham, was suspended. It
is difficult to understand why this man was singled out for
suspension, as he was by no means the prime mover of the
Liverpool movement; Norman, Ryan (the treasurer), and
others there being far more prominent. Nottingham was
away ill at home when the officials desired him to be brought
before them, and he was accordingly brought, ill as he was,
in a cab to the office. After hearing his sentence of suspension
he was allowed to return home as best he might. When the
Liverpool men realised what had taken place the excitement
and indignation was great, and a meeting was called for the
same evening. The meeting was held at a house in Ann
Street. They had no sooner met, however, than they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
made aware that the house was being watched by official
detectives, who were stationed to secretly take the names of
those attending. The warning was passed to those on their
way to the meeting; while those who had already assembled
were passed out by another door. Another rendezvous was
found a little later at the Great Eastern Hotel, and here the
eager crowd of outlawed telegraphists met to discuss the
serious situation. Here it was decided, as the result of their
deliberations, to present an ultimatum to the postmaster to
the effect that if the suspended men were not reinstated by
noon, and a definite time fixed for the proper classification of
the staff, they would turn out on strike. To solemnise the
decision come to a borrowed Bible was produced, and the men
present swore upon it that they would be true to each other, and
not desert the cause. Telegrams were forthwith despatched
that night informing other towns what Liverpool had decided
on. These telegrams were, however, as it was suspected,
intercepted. The ultimatum was next day, December 8th,
presented to the postmaster, and they waited. Twelve
o’clock struck, and simultaneously a gong, the sounding of
which was the prearranged signal for decisive action, began
to ring. Immediately every one rose from his place in the
instrument-room. But before they could leave in a body,
the postmaster appeared on the scene, and standing in the
doorway, made a speech in terms of entreaty and warning
and proceeded to read an official paper. But by this time
the feeling had got out of bounds; the tide had risen and was
not to be pushed back with a mop. The postmaster had
to stand aside, and the operators swept past him, then into
the street; and the strike began. If there was one office
in particular that showed the example it was Liverpool;
Manchester, Bradford, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Dublin, and Cork,
where similar scenes had occurred, following suit immediately
afterwards.</p>

<p>The same evening a meeting was held at the Clock Inn,
when a telegram was read from Mr. Scudamore to the Liverpool
postmaster stating that the Manchester strikers had gone in to
their duties. In his anxiety and excess of zeal during this
troublous time the Under-Secretary was not above practising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
deception on the men, believing probably that the end justified
the means. It was to get the recalcitrants back to work that
this telegram was sent from headquarters. But the ruse was
detected by the presence in Liverpool of a Manchester delegate,
who was able on the spot to at once contradict it and
reassure the Liverpool men that his town was firm. The
suspension of the leaders was the signal for a general strike,
and brought to a culminating point all the resentment and
dissatisfaction which had been rankling within the breasts of
the men for a twelvemonth past. In an instant the disquieting
news was flashed from Manchester and Liverpool to every
outpost in the kingdom. The beacons flamed up everywhere
in a single hour. With one accord the men not only of Liverpool,
but of Bradford, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Dublin, and Cork,
struck, and refused to resume their duties until the suspended
men at Manchester were reinstated. As showing the spirit
that animated them, one of the Manchester officials of the
association, who was on sick leave through an accident, immediately
on learning the step that had been taken sent a message
to his chief to the effect that he also was to be regarded as out
on strike.</p>

<p>But the secret censorship exercised over all telegrams suspected
of emanating from the affected men considerably handicapped
them in their action. Still, by the use of their prearranged
code—whole sentences being signified by such names and words
as “Turkish,” “Canadian,” “Trunks,” “Bonds,” “Arabia,”
&amp;c., &amp;c.—they were fairly well able to communicate with Manchester
and other places. Conflicting rumours, which it was
not always easy to contradict or verify on the spot, were set
afloat as to the movements. But what had been a strike at
Manchester and elsewhere became a little later a lock-out at
various other offices in the provinces. The assistance and
sympathy shown by the telegraphists of other towns betrayed
a feeling of general unrest, and there were other symptoms
as unmistakable which decided the authorities to deal summarily
with the whole. They decided on a <i lang="fr">coup d’état</i>, hoping
that one bold stroke would terrorise them into obedience and
smash their organisation.</p>

<p>At noon next day it was noticed at various offices that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
messages received bore the signatures of strange senders at the
other end of the wires. The fact occasioned no little comment,
and the telegraphists of Bradford, Hull, and elsewhere,
and in all the offices which of late had made themselves prominent
in agitation, were not long in arriving at the correct
conclusion. The storm had come, and they had got to face
it, as they relied on their comrades in other distant towns also
facing it. The same method of procedure happened everywhere,
and in every affected office alike. A man was mysteriously
sent away from his instrument and did not return, then
another, and another. Meanwhile those remaining at the
instruments were endeavouring to obtain some information
from the other end, but to all their inquiries there was dead
silence, and they realised that their interrogations had only
met with the fate of being silently recorded against them many
miles away. Then some one in the room would break the
tension of silence, and they would troop out in a body, knowing
as if by instinct that the same was being faithfully enacted
elsewhere. Then in most cases as they trooped out from the
instrument-room they would be confronted with several burly
town policemen, who would half direct, half hustle them into
another room, where they were virtually made prisoners awaiting
the pleasure of the local postmaster. In some cases the
postmaster would carry out his official instruction neatly and
politely. If it were so, all went well; but in several instances
the blundering over-zeal of an unpopular martinet nearly precipitated
a riot. There is reason to think that the official
instruction from London was to the effect that it should be
effected as quietly and as discreetly as possible, and with few
exceptions the delicate task of the postmasters was so carried
out. Then while the telegraphists were waiting the arrival of
the postmaster and other officials from whom they were to learn
what was expected of them, a number of strangers newly arrived
from London took their vacant places in the instrument-room.
That being done, the door would be opened and the work of
inquisition began. Generally the local postmaster would be
accompanied by the officials, and in some cases by the influential
public men of the town, the mayor or the vicar.
They were admonished for their behaviour in leaving their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
instruments in the manner they had, even though it had been
so confidently expected that they would act so, and they were
offered the opportunity of going back to their work, but on
conditions which they as a body could not accept.</p>

<p>In one case, at Bradford, they were preached to for half-an-hour
by a colonial bishop, the vicar of the town, Bishop Ryan,
on the duties of obedience to their pastors and masters, and
the desirability of remaining good and dutiful in that position
in which it had pleased God for some wise purpose to place
them. The good bishop, however, did not forget, in the course
of his little homily, to turn to the officials forming a cordon
round the postmaster, and remind them that it was his opinion
that the men were being disgracefully treated. The postmaster
addressed them, and others addressed them. But the men
having taken the step they had, and feeling certain that exactly
the same step was being taken in all other towns, would not
return to work that day. The men were then released on their
own recognisances. Later, however, they were again called
up, and directly questioned as to whether they each belonged
to their association; and if so, would they sign an agreement
to relinquish their society, and promise never again to agitate?
As was only to be anticipated, every self-respecting man refused.
They were then, in some cases by policemen already stationed,
unceremoniously bundled into the street as dismissed from
Post-Office employ.</p>

<p>In each of the towns where this took place there was generally
much sympathy shown for the locked-out or rather dismissed
men. At Liverpool there was a public meeting outside
Brown’s Library. A strike fund was organised, and some of
the leading cotton and stockbrokers of the Exchange contributed
to the fund no less than £70 by passing round the hat.</p>

<p>On the following Monday a prominent representative of
trades unionism in Liverpool waited on the committee and
offered to pay all expenses if they would raise an action at law
against Mr. Frank Ives Scudamore for having suspended the
leaders of their movement, as the trade unionists of Liverpool
were of the opinion that such suspensions were illegal. A sum
of £1000 was freely mentioned, and it was stated that they
were anxious to see the matter tested. This offer to defray the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
expenses of the prosecution was the result of a discussion on
the question that arose at the Trades Union Congress at
Nottingham. It was definitely proposed to prosecute Mr.
Scudamore not only for illegally suspending members of a
trades union, but for illegally suppressing their telegrams, and
also wilfully delaying press messages. The Trades Union
Congress would assist financially.</p>

<p>On the day before the strike a telegram was forwarded from
Manchester to the <cite>Daily News</cite>, intended for insertion as a
press item, from one of the staff in relation to the suspension
of the leaders there. The stoppage of this telegram by the
authorities aroused the strongest indignation of the <cite>Daily
News</cite>, and next day it commented in no measured terms on
the “arbitrary and unjustifiable conduct of the London authorities.”
It was described as an attempt to establish a Russian
censorship over news. Delays of telegraphic communications
were frequent within this brief period, and to conciliate the
public on the point the Post-Office Secretary was afterwards
publicly admonished with a wink by the Postmaster-General.</p>

<p>The press of the kingdom vigorously protested against the
action of the Post-Office Secretary, whose excuse was that he was
compelled to do so in order to prevent what he termed the mutiny
from spreading. This, however, did not stop the complaints in
the House of Commons; and at last the Postmaster-General,
Mr. Monsell, stated that Mr. Scudamore had to be officially
censured for his action. This was considered the first gain of
the despised telegraph employé in the House of Commons.</p>

<p>On the same day that this offer was made, it was announced
that the postmaster had been informed by one of their representatives
that if all the men who had struck were allowed to
return without prejudice, the strike would terminate. But the
postmaster, in reply, stated that no terms from the disaffected
clerks themselves would be accepted; and none would be
allowed to resume unless they signed an officially-prepared
form, expressing regret for insubordination and begging to be
allowed to resume duty on the terms of Mr. Scudamore’s
notice. At a meeting of the Liverpool men, held at the Clock
the same evening, this announcement from the Liverpool postmaster
was received with hisses and dissent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>The day following a circular was issued to the strikers,
signed by Mr. Scudamore, which was to the effect that they
were to be recorded as being dismissed.</p>

<p>The department, in deciding on taking this simultaneous
step at a certain hour on one day, had made what preparations
were possible at so short a notice; but, as was only to be expected,
the public service suffered accordingly for many days
to come. Men with a knowledge of telegraphy were not so
easy to obtain, as those who knew their work were appraised
by the remaining companies at a somewhat higher value than
the Government chose to put upon them. Consequently the
men who were engaged to fill the places of those dismissed
constituted a various and motley crowd for the most part,
and in some cases actually had to learn their work as they
went along. The natural result of so many immature telegraphists
being put to the work was a complete wrecking of
telegraphic communication for days afterwards. The men
who were recruited from London principally were, however,
little to blame, either for the breakdown in the service or for
the part they were made to play. For the most part they
were complete strangers to each other; men picked up from
almost every walk in life; many of them had known privation,
and were glad of a berth under any conditions. It was therefore
not greatly surprising that they knew as little of <i lang="fr">esprit de
corps</i> as they knew of telegraphy when first engaged.</p>

<p>What had really happened in London when the Postmaster-General
and his advisers decided on a preconcerted signal to
the postmasters of the provincial towns, was this: The class
of pseudo-telegraphists already described, having been engaged
some weeks before and put through a painful course of
self-tuition, were at the end of that time regarded as having
matriculated sufficiently for the purpose for which they were
principally wanted. Then they were each in turn asked if
they would care to be transferred to some provincial town,
Liverpool, Manchester, or wherever it might be. All objections
and demurs if any were immediately met by the offer to
pay all expenses. One at a time they were called into a room
at the Chief Office in Telegraph Street, and told to prepare at
a few hours’ notice to be sent where their services were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
most required. The question of railway fares, and wives and
children, and removal of home belongings was peremptorily
brushed aside. They had only to name an approximate
amount as covering all expenses, and, to their pleased astonishment,
that sum was placed before them. The Controller’s
clerk was a few feet away presiding over an open
box of gold, and on each of these poor seedy fellows being
asked to name his amount, it was given him with no more
trouble than obtaining his signature. It is not to be wondered
at that the men were so easily tempted. If they were guilty
of what in trade-union parlance is known as “blacklegging,”
then their offence was a venial one, inasmuch as they were
not in a position to realise to the full what was being enacted.</p>

<p>The telegraphists’ strike would probably have proved a
greater success, from their own point of view, but for this
temptation. And it was this reflection that occasioned the
somewhat strained feeling between London and the provinces
for some years following the incident.</p>

<p>The strike collapsed owing to the difficulties in rendering
their organisation complete before such a drastic step was
taken, and their unpreparedness to meet the prompt and decisive
action of the department. The contemplated attitude
of the telegraphists was known to the authorities long before
it was definitely taken up by the men; their every move was
anticipated. It was therefore, and considering all things, not
to be wondered at that they found themselves outmanœuvred
at the finish. That the department should have so completely
squelched the movement in the manner it did was a matter
for congratulation from a public point of view. But it must
not be forgotten that all the legitimate appeals made by the
telegraphists had produced no result but bitterness and disappointment;
while the very means adopted by the authorities
to avert such a contingency went far to precipitate it.</p>

<p>It is only fair to say that the department on this occasion
extended a little clemency even in the hour of its victory. It
was sufficient for it to have proved its power and authority,
and—especially taking into consideration how useful, after all,
were the services of such men at that time of day—it was
amenable to reason, and allowed itself to be influenced on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
behalf of the dismissed and locked-out men. Six or seven of
the more prominent agitators had been dismissed outright,
while the locked-out men were kept out a considerable time
before they were allowed to resume duty. These were all,
with one or two exceptions, brought back one at a time
through the influence of public men. Mulholland and three
other Manchester men were not given the chance to return
until six weeks afterwards. During the time of his suspension
it was made pretty plain to him that he might return whenever
he chose, on certain conditions; but Mulholland resisted
both blandishments and threats, and stuck to his guns unflinchingly
during all the severe examinations through which
he passed. The official desire was to obtain the books,
documents, and papers in Mulholland’s possession, which
related to the business and the working of the agitation.
That desire of Mr. Scudamore was communicated to him
through the Manchester officials.</p>

<p>The only reply sent in by the sturdy agitator was that
the entire matter of his recent interview with the postmaster
having been truthfully communicated by him to the rest of
the suspended men, there was nothing to submit for Mr.
Scudamore’s consideration but the grievances of the telegraph
operators, which led to the formation of an association.
While his fate was trembling in the balance, he still maintained,
in the most respectful terms, however, that this
combination of telegraphists meant nothing more than an
endeavour to obtain, not only their fair and equitable demands,
but the performance of promises given by Mr. Scudamore
himself. Further, Mulholland vigorously maintained
that only the absence of an association at the time of the
transfer was responsible for their being neglected for so long
by the State department. During the whole time that these
overtures were being made by the Manchester officials desirous
of obtaining possession of the papers which would
implicate others, Mulholland never for a moment lost his
self-respect, or was tempted to forget what was due to himself
as an honest man. On his refusal to deliver up the coveted
documents, the official whose duty it had been to negotiate
the bargain of betrayal attempted to deny that he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
“either insisted on it or made a condition of it.” Immediately
following on this came a request for an explanation in
writing as to why he should not be dismissed the service.
The “explanation” was furnished promptly enough. But
whether the official mind was ashamed to carry the matter
so far, or the authorities felt bound to respect the honourable
consistency of the man, Mulholland was not dismissed after
all; at the end of six weeks’ suspension being quietly allowed
to resume his place. The rest of the Manchester staff meanwhile,
misled by the false and contradictory reports that the
clerks in other towns were wavering or willingly returning to
duty, gradually themselves resumed work.</p>

<p>While most of the men who comprised the committees in
the various towns were still under suspension, a grand concert
was organised at Liverpool on their behalf, and to help to
defray the expenses that had been incurred. The concert
took place at the Concert Hall, Lord Nelson Street, on December
22nd, 1871. It was highly successful; Mr. Osmond
Tearle, the well-known actor, who in his earlier days had
been a Liverpool telegraph clerk in the old “Magnetic
Company,” rendering great assistance with his recitations
of “Eugene Aram” and other pieces. A special prologue
was spoken on this occasion, in which the following lines
occurred:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“But hold, enough about the little wire</div>
<div class="verse">Which carries all the tidings we require.</div>
<div class="verse">’Tis of the workers we would speak to-night,</div>
<div class="verse">Who, but for asking what was just and right,</div>
<div class="verse">Are turned adrift to face the world anew;</div>
<div class="verse">And first they seek their sympathy from you.</div>
<div class="verse">Withhold it not in this their hour of need;</div>
<div class="verse">And may to-night’s proceedings quickly lead</div>
<div class="verse">To well-paid work where energy and skill</div>
<div class="verse">May meet with justice, kindness, and goodwill.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The suspended men on whose behalf the concert was held
were Messrs. Norman, Ryan, Robinson, Nottingham, and
others.</p>

<p>Within a fortnight after the collapse of the strike, the whole
of the suspended men at Liverpool were reinstated. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
men of other affected towns were similarly recalled to duty,
or induced to return by promises that the grievances of telegraphists
generally should be immediately seen into. Thus
terminated the brief but exciting strike period of 1871.</p>

<p>Ashden of Bradford, regarded as one of the principal ringleaders,
being allowed to return, was after a while dismissed
for “generally unsatisfactory conduct.” Few of those who had
participated in the recent unfortunate attempt at a strike
were allowed to remain at their own offices, for fear their
influence might survive, and it was thought a very necessary
precaution to transport them to other distant places. By
this means they were well distributed about the country, as it
was thought that a man finding himself among strangers would
be less prone to give effect to his proclivity for agitation.</p>

<p>Judged on the surface, the strike was a complete failure;
but its actual effect was a lesson both to the men and the
authorities. It rudely awakened the department to the fact
that some improvement was imperatively necessary; and at the
same time it paved the way for a protective organisation on an
improved and permanent basis.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt that these few days of excitement
and agitation must have been very trying to one in the
position of Mr. Frank Ives Scudamore. Though perhaps he
had to take some share of the blame for making possible the
strike, it must be said he acted with some tact, firmness, mud
moderation in the handling of an extremely delicate as well as
difficult problem which had thus suddenly confronted the
department. But he might have averted it in the beginning
by a little of the good judgment and moderation displayed
towards the end. His warning circular issued to the strikers
the day after they broke out of bounds, was almost as much an
appeal as a command to the erring ones to return to the fold.
He seems to have been a somewhat gentle nature whom circumstances
eventually hardened into an indifferent diplomatist.</p>

<p>Then there was a breathing time for some months, and the
men cautiously refrained from discussing and advertising their
grievances too freely, but they were sustained by the hope,
based on semi-official information, that some sort of remedial
measure was being prepared by the department.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>In August 1872 the hope was realised. A scheme of classification
was introduced, and its reception was hailed with
increased satisfaction when it was found that it dated back
nearly a year, and covered the strike period. Under this
scheme some few clerks received an immediate rise in wages,
and considerable sums in back pay. That in itself was a most
palatable sauce, and helped the digestion of the scheme very
considerably for some. Whatever the intention of its authors,
it proved to be not so fair as it appeared on the surface; and
its application to practical uses proved its worthlessness in
meeting all the demands of the telegraphists. With the monetary
improvements, so far as the maximum was concerned,
there was perhaps least to grumble at; but it left entirely
untouched the other grievances which pressed so sorely upon
them.</p>

<p>Perhaps the name of “Scudamore’s Folly,” by which it
afterwards came to be distinguished, most aptly described it.
The dissatisfaction which it so soon produced placed it almost
beyond doubt that it was full of leakages. The higher rates
of pay were regarded as so far beyond the immediate reach of
the majority that the solatium of back money bestowed on
the fortunate few was soon forgotten; it was found that the
promised promotion speedily came to a standstill; and there
obtained, generally, the same annoying and irritating conditions
as prevailed before the strike. The evils which the
Scudamore scheme was set to cure, were by its operation rather
accentuated than mitigated. The telegraph staff, which then
numbered 5233, were divided into numerous classes with
absurdly low wages, and increments which were microscopic.
The ultimate prospect of a decent living wage was so dim and
distant that it was scarcely worth taking into account. By the
scales of pay indicated in the scheme, a telegraphist had to
creep up from a minimum of eight or ten shillings a week by
annual increments of a shilling till he reached the halting-ground
of twenty-one shillings a week. By the time he
reached this guinea a week he was a full-grown man, ready in
the natural course of things to become the head of a family in
the full performance of his duties as a father and a citizen.
Many of them then, needless to say, had so far tempted misfortune.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
And having arrived at the guinea a week, the lowness
of their wage rendered them the ready slaves of the
department at sixpence an hour for overtime. A period of
sixteen years was allowed by the scheme for a man to reach
the Elysium of the second class, which rose from £70 to £90
a year. For the sum of a guinea a week gratuitous Sunday
labour was imposed, and for eighteen years was rigidly exacted
because it was in the bond. When at last public opinion
compelled the resumption of payment for Sunday work, the
department with unconscious irony granted it as a “concession,”
and afterwards pointed to it as a reason for continuing
an inadequate scale of wages.</p>

<p>At the introduction of the scheme the London force consisted
of 688 men and 1038 women. To seven-tenths of the
male staff it gave an average mean wage of 23s. 5d. a week, and
to the remaining three-tenths, 55s. 4d., or 32s. a week more than
the others. The reason for such a striking difference on so
trifling a wage-scale was not made public. The female section
met with similar Shylock-like generosity. Eighty-one per cent
got between 16s. and 17s. weekly, and the rest 31s. The
actual scale in the Central Telegraph Office was:—</p>

<table summary="Pay">
  <tr>
    <td>Senior Class</td>
    <td>£140 to £160</td>
    <td>by £5 per annum.</td>

    <td>£100 to £130</td>
    <td><span class="ditto">”</span> <span class="ditto">”</span></td>

    <td>£45 to £65</td>
    <td><span class="ditto">”</span> <span class="ditto">”</span></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>What has always been derisively referred to as “Scudamore’s
Folly,” condemned the London telegraphist to a life of
poverty; but it condemned his fellow in the provinces to something
worse. The provincial male force numbered 3507, and
out of this number the generous author of the scheme placed
213 male officers on fixed wages of 7s., 8s., and 10s. a week;
while to 151 young men it gave 12s. a week, rising by annual
increments of 6d. to 15s.—a state of things closely analogous
to the disgraceful boy-sorter system in vogue on the postal side
at the same period. The rest of the provincial male officers
were divided into small groups, but it is sufficient to say that
the greatest money-making department of the State had the
effrontery to fix the average mean pay of 3012, or 88.4 per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
cent. of the whole staff, at less than a guinea a week. Only
405 received the weekly wage of 50s.</p>

<p>By the great majority the “Scudamore Folly” was received
with resentment; and it was not long before it produced a
plentiful crop of petitions, protests, and appeals, which,
however, were only received politely to be pigeon-holed
indefinitely.</p>

<p>A Select Committee of the House of Commons sat in 1876,
to inquire into the whole working of the telegraphs, and in
their report to the House strongly recommended the desirability
of training the operators in the scientific and technical
knowledge of the complex and delicate apparatus by which
they had to perform their official duties. This was expected
to procure some further official acknowledgment of the value
and importance of telegraph work. But the importance and
signification of this recommendation does not appear to have
struck the official mind till June 1880, when the Secretary
notified that in future promotion would to a considerable
extent be dependent on the acquisition of this technical knowledge.
The invitation was responded to very largely in the
hope that some benefit would accrue; but all the time energy
and confidence were wasted completely.</p>

<p>Men had still to perform overtime at inadequate rates of pay
to supplement their incomes, and they were still inordinately
punished for comparatively trivial errors and shortcomings.
Altogether the service, in spite of this Scudamore scheme,
became so unpopular and so unbearable for a number that,
according to a special Parliamentary return, no fewer than
2341 out of 6000 telegraph clerks left during a period of eight
and a half years, a large number joining the cable companies,
where they received better treatment and more encouragement.
Certainly there must have been something radically wrong to
account for this extraordinary exodus, and for the fact that
public servants were driven wholesale to seek refuge with
private employers.</p>

<p>Dissatisfaction became so rife that after about eight years,
namely in November 1880, a fresh movement was set afoot.
This time it was at Liverpool that the phœnix was to rise from
its ashes.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<p>DISSATISFACTION AMONG TELEGRAPHISTS—STARTING A NEW
ORGANISATION—CONFERENCE AT LIVERPOOL—THREATENED
TELEGRAPH STRIKE—THE FAWCETT SCHEME AND
THE TELEGRAPHISTS.</p>

</div>

<p>Electrical influences had been in the air for some years
since the Manchester outburst, but a feeling partly of timidity
partly of apathy had prevented section joining with section
until some time after the Scudamore scheme. Nothing seemingly
was done by the department to attempt to check the
wholesale exodus from the service. One consequence of this
“great retreat,” as it was called, was that those who remained
to supply their places were worked the harder. Nominally
the hours were eight, but fourteen, fifteen, and even seventeen
hours were commonly worked in a single day when the exigencies
of the service demanded it.</p>

<p>The Scudamore scheme of classification, which should have
stood self-condemned by this time even from a departmental
point of view, was nevertheless tenaciously clung to by the
officials as a parent clings to its child. Yet opposed as they
were to all modification towards bettering the condition of the
telegraphists, it was at length driven home to the authorities
that something was needed to allay the daily growing discontent
caused mainly by this detested scheme. But only a slight
modification was made, and that with timidity and reluctance.
The Scudamore system had egregiously failed of its purpose,
but its authors were yet slow to see it. Not even the patent
fact that it was false economy and a waste of public profits to
spend large sums in training telegraph operators who, one out
of every three, ultimately took their knowledge and experience
elsewhere, was sufficient to convince them. The improvement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
that they were at last compelled to make consisted of
a sixpence increase in the year—an eighteenpence increment
instead of a shilling—and one or two barriers to promotion
were removed. But tinkering and botching of this kind were
of no avail in mitigating the real sterner hardships and injustices
for which “Scudamore’s Folly” was responsible.</p>

<p>When it was seen that the department were bent on doing
nothing further, the most cautious became indifferent to consequences,
and their loyalty to the public service was put to
the severest strain. Men who before had held back, with no
stomach for agitation in any shape or form, now began to feel
that it was their duty to take up arms in the common cause;
the most conservative felt that what they were risking was
scarcely worth preserving.</p>

<p>The dissatisfaction became so general and so acute towards
the beginning of 1880 that it was evident it could no longer
be kept within bounds.</p>

<p>That the Post-Office had persistently ignored what was
averred to be a direct instruction of the Legislature as signified
in the particular clause of the Telegraph Act of 1868, was the
mainspring of the agitation of this period. On that clause the
hopes of the telegraph service were centred, and the renewed
agitation which was now to commence was mainly to be
directed towards the attainment of this object and the fulfilment
of this clause. Great uneasiness had existed among
telegraph clerks for some time with regard to their position
and future prospects; but it was not till the beginning of
December 1880 that their grievances found open expression;
and only then in isolated petitions from various offices, which
failed to secure attention. The third-class clerks of Birmingham
had endeavoured, by means of correspondence in the
<cite>Civil Service Gazette</cite> and communication with other towns,
to establish an understanding as to a plan of future action
among telegraph clerks throughout the country. These efforts
were, however, only partly successful, few towns responding to
the call to co-operate.</p>

<p>The seed had so far fallen on stony ground, but not so at
Liverpool. An article from the <cite>Civil Service Gazette</cite> being
received there from Birmingham on 26th November, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
question of co-operation was placed before the staff for consideration.
A meeting was held the following evening, and
after a lengthy discussion it was unanimously decided to enter
upon vigorous action and rally to the assistance of Birmingham.
A committee and officers were appointed, and a correspondence
at once opened with other large towns to ascertain what
steps had already been taken towards united action. These
inquiries this time elicited a ready and hearty response, which
far exceeded the most sanguine expectation, and it was safe to
conjecture that a plan of campaign was now really possible.
The movement, if such it might be called, had up to that
moment been purely a third-class one, and it was now established
on a broader and more comprehensive basis. The
<cite>Civil Service Gazette</cite> was more than ever used for ventilating
their grievances. But confusion ensued from the many and
multifarious schemes proposed; and this only forced home
the conviction which had been slowly growing, that the ranks
should be brought into proper line, and that a few should
assume a recognised command, and that they should have a
workable base at one of the large town offices, from whence
proposals might be put forward for general adoption. Liverpool,
being in the first line of importance and convenient as a
centre, in conformity with a generally-expressed desire, therefore
consented to take up the position of premier and pioneer.
After mature deliberations on all available suggestions cognate
to the work before them, Liverpool issued a circular to every
office in the kingdom, and branches were instituted everywhere.
Fresh offices flocked to the new standard every day, and the
movement developed with astonishing rapidity. Not an important
office, with the exception of two, held aloof. The
metropolitan offices added new columns of support to the
rapidly-increasing structure; London and the provinces were
at last welded into one.</p>

<p>Their progress had, however, been not altogether unchecked,
for in some quarters the authorities, looking askance on the
strongly-advancing tide, in a futile manner tried to resist it by
bringing pressure to bear on particular prominent men. But
the feeling had gained ground too rapidly; the fire was alight,
and had taken hold of the entire service by this time, and as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
fast as the official foot sought to stamp it out in one quarter it
reappeared in another. At Sheffield and Cardiff there was
some little trouble, and a few were made the sufferers for
their progressive efforts; but the telegraphists everywhere else
proved equal to all the coercion that was brought to bear on
them.</p>

<p>By this time they were not wanting for public friends, and
many members of Parliament, who had expressed their surprise
at the low wages and poor prospects held out to telegraphists,
some thirty or forty of them, had voluntarily offered to do
what was possible for them in the House of Commons when
the time came. Prominent among those members of Parliament
who had guaranteed their support were Mr. Monk—who
years before had obtained for postal servants the enjoyment
of the franchise—Mr. Macliver, Sir Henry Drummond
Wolff, Mr. Joseph Cowen, Mr. Jacob Bright, Lord Sandown,
Lord Charles Hamilton, and Mr. (afterwards Sir) Stafford
Northcote; while Mr. John Bright and Mr. Joseph Chamberlain
had also expressed sympathy and were interesting themselves
on behalf of their Birmingham constituents. Added to
this phalanx of Parliamentary support, the press had warmly
taken up the telegraphists’ cause; and there was scarcely a
paper of importance that had not from time to time some
reference to the agitation, and commented on the moderation
and reasonableness of the claims put forward by the men.
There was also a petition from the members of the London
Stock Exchange on behalf of the men to the Postmaster-General,
which bore 2000 signatures.</p>

<p>Professor Henry Fawcett himself, who had now become
Postmaster-General, had led them to believe, in a speech at
Manchester in January, that they might expect the fullest
justice at his hands, and had promised to carefully consider
their petitions. But one and all felt that it was necessary
to strengthen the hands of the Postmaster-General, however
liberal his intentions might be. They knew, and their public
friends knew, that there was a power behind the throne which
would have to be reckoned with.</p>

<p>The flowing tide of discontent, swollen by numberless tributaries
from all over the United Kingdom, emptied itself into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
Liverpool on the 15th and 16th January 1881. On those
two days the first conference of telegraph clerks was held,
and from then was to date the progress of the real telegraph
movement.</p>

<p>The success, so far, of the telegraphists’ agitation, and its
being brought so rapidly to this important stage, was due for
the most part to one man, Norman, now a telegraphist of
Bristol, transferred from Liverpool in 1871.</p>

<p>Norman was a distinct personality, and from the first
moment in 1871, when discontent became rife, he had been
an influence. He, in conjunction with Ashden, Mulholland,
Ryan, and others, it was who brought about the earlier agitation.
Originally himself a Liverpudlian, he had been made
to suffer for the part he took on that occasion by being transported
to Bristol. In Liverpool he was on his native heath
once more, and he was destined to take the lead for some
time henceforth. He had had no difficulty with a few others,
Kellamay, Brighton, and Alvine, in setting fire to Bristol.
He could not be classed as an eloquent speaker, yet he nearly
always convinced; his well-measured tones always carried
their point. His organising capacity was that of a general.
He was a character eminently trusted, and easily begot a feeling
of security among his followers. At Bristol there had
been some doubts among the juniors that if this agitation were
entered on the “pre-transfer” men might try only for a satisfactory
settlement of their own case to the detriment of the
juniors, and some little friction seemed likely; but Norman
simply gave one word of assurance, and all had such faith in
him that perfect unanimity was restored.</p>

<p>This conference at Liverpool, which he had been so instrumental
in bringing about, was to shape their future, and
Norman was to point the way. A common programme was decided
on; a permanent Telegraphists’ Association was decided
on, and the work of formulating a national petition was put
into the hands of the Liverpool committee. A permanent
association was agreed on as the outcome of this first conference
of telegraph clerks; but it is a little curious to note that
even Norman, whose original proposal it was, displayed some
hesitation in the open adoption of the trades-union principle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
It might be called an association for mutual benefit, or anything
they chose, said Norman, “but whatever shape it might
take, it must be as broad as possible, so that the department
could not say, ‘You have a trades union.’” Even Heald of
Manchester, one of the strike agitators, and a man who had
suffered for his temerity on that occasion, took the view that
to form a trades union of telegraphists would be to forfeit the
support of the public, whose interests were so closely allied to
those of the department. In this year of 1881, when trades
unionism recognised as such reared its head among every
class of labour and was not ashamed, they as Government
servants did not deem it wise to inscribe so much as its name
on their banner. Bound as they were, almost, to accept it in
spirit and essence, such was their conception of the public’s
requirements in the matter, and such their inclination to make
concession to this old-fashioned sentiment indulged in by so
many of their Parliamentary supporters, that they felt it would
be imprudent to distinguish their movement by any label
likely to offend such a prejudice. They were progressive
enough in principle. They had men among them who had
suffered in the cause of progress, and who were willing to do
so again; but they were not yet prepared to go the length of
the postal agitators of a past decade, who had openly proclaimed
themselves by joining with the London Trades
Council. There were some among them who, indeed, had
doubts about the legality of Government servants doing so
in any case. So far as any such doubt was entertained, it was
possibly a survival of that feeling which had caused the telegraphists
of 1871 to refuse the offer of a sum of £1000 for
the prosecution of Mr. Frank Ives Scudamore for suspending
men for forming an association.</p>

<p>Again, it had to be remembered that they were claiming
to be classed as Lower Division clerks of the Civil Service as
embraced by the terms of the Playfair scheme, and, as they
conceived it, confirmed by an Order in Council in 1876.
The arguments in support of this claim seemed most valid,
and they had the authority of eminent counsel in support of
their ambitious though, after all, reasonable claim. It was,
therefore very natural, perhaps, that while they endorsed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
accepted the principle, they should hesitate to weaken their
case by avowedly adopting its ritual and its garb. Whether
they were fully justified in so thinking is another matter, and
it is the fact that has to be recorded.</p>

<p>It was not that Norman and those associated with him had
not sufficient sympathy with the principle or the necessary
courage to proclaim the fact. It was only that they were not
as yet certain of their followers, who were made up of men of
every shade of opinion, or of the advisability of calling a
spade a spade. Yet they were to have their trades union just
the same; and from the first moment of its being launched
some few months later, in December 1881, the whole organisation
was to be run on trades-union lines. But up to the
present they had done no more than agree as to the necessity
of a permanent society; its actual formation must wait a little
longer.</p>

<p>The one immediate outcome of the first Liverpool conference
was the drawing up of a united petition, setting forth
for the first time concisely and clearly their various claims.
There were five principal grievances enumerated, together
with the reasons for their removal. The first grievance complained
of was the inadequate salary, and the hindrance to
promotion given by classification. The second was as to the
irregular as well as inadequate mode of payment for overtime;
the third complained of was that there was no special payment
made for Sunday, Good Friday, or Christmas Day duties;
and it was therefore asked that these holidays be paid for
as overtime. The fourth complained of was the insufficient
annual leave of absence; and the fifth complained of the
insufficient subsistence allowance to clerks employed away
from home on special or relief duties. This petition was
signed by every office of importance in the kingdom, Liverpool,
Manchester, Glasgow, and Birmingham taking the lead
in the number of signatures; and it was then presented in
the beginning of February. With far greater expedition than
they had hoped for, the Postmaster-General, Mr. Fawcett,
intimated his willingness to discuss the points with a deputation
of telegraphists. Accordingly, on the 15th March 1881,
a deputation of telegraph clerks, including their leading man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
Norman, was received by Mr. Fawcett. It was on this occasion
that the real strength of Norman was well displayed.
The accredited orator of the telegraphists’ movement, Michael
O’Toole, was present; but it does no injustice to him to say
that Norman’s closely-reasoned statement, made up principally
of facts and figures which were incontrovertible, must have
been more convincing to Mr. Fawcett than were O’Toole’s
more brilliant pyrotechnics. Instead of being allowed to
state their grievances unreservedly, however, they found that
the supporters and advisers of the Postmaster-General would
allow them only to answer questions. Even the brilliant
O’Toole was told that he was “not answering questions, but
making a speech.”</p>

<p>The interview from which so much had been expected was
therefore not deemed satisfactory. The deputation found that
they had to impress and convince not only Mr. Fawcett, but the
permanent officials, who were numerously represented, and who
considerably hampered freedom of discussion by their insisting
that certain questions only be answered. The men desired
to plead their own case in their own fashion as they had been
invited to, but it was seen that Mr. Fawcett’s honourable
desire was being quietly and firmly overruled, so that the
interview terminated without many of the very necessary explanatory
statements being introduced as was intended.</p>

<p>The disaffection grew apace, and a consciousness of their
strength and the justice of their demands rendered them
reliant. The agitation was renewed with increased activity.
Mr. Macliver and other M.P.’s rallied to their support.
Numerous meetings were held all over the country, while the
sympathy of the press and the public gave a character and an
importance to their movement that could not much longer
be ignored by the Government. The service was swept from
end to end by a hurricane of discontent that had had no parallel
even in the postmen’s agitation of a few years before. The
telegraphists were angered, and anger was becoming defiance.
It was becoming a question as to how much longer they could
be kept within bounds.</p>

<p>Mr. Fawcett, true to his democratic instinct, felt the greatest
reluctance in imposing restrictions on the right of free public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
meeting among postal servants. His attention had been drawn,
both by the officials and in the House of Commons, to reports
of public meetings of postal and telegraph employés, and he
expressed himself cognisant of these proceedings, at the same
time intimating that it was not his intention to interfere or to
visit any official punishment on those who had taken a prominent
part. Undoubtedly some of the platform utterances
of this period were rather extreme, and the distinguished
Postmaster-General was not kept in ignorance of the fact.
His forbearance was that of a strong and courageous man,
and he probably felt that the best reply he could give to all
the far-fetched assertions of the impatient army under his
control was to presently offer them the scheme which he was
then so busily preparing.</p>

<p>But meeting followed meeting and protest followed protest,
till the blind, badgered Postmaster-General felt that he was at
last face to face with the stern reality of a threatened strike.
Then for the first time he uttered a cry of resentment. They
ought to have learnt by this time that the delay was not due
to any neglect of his; they ought to have known by this time
that he who had allowed the utmost freedom both in petitioning
and public meeting, who lost no opportunity of finding
out for himself what was wrong, was in reality an enemy of
the official fetishism of which they most complained. In a
Post-Office Circular issued March 30, 1881, he strongly animadverted
on the extreme course they were pursuing, and the
manner in which the facts of the recent interview had been
distorted by several members of the deputation. He maintained
that he had never made any intimation that he would
receive them alone without the presence of the permanent
officials; that it would have been contrary to all practice in
the public service had the principal officers of the department
not been present; and, as he had stated elsewhere, the object
of the interview was simply to furnish him with such additional
information as he might desire to receive. He expressed his
strong disapprobation of their impatience and their method of
showing it, but at the same time he conveyed a promise that
nothing would prevent him from “doing full justice to the
case of the telegraphists generally.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>The very severe rebuke contained in Mr. Fawcett’s circular
to the postal telegraphists was by many among them felt to be
in nowise undeserved, and being administered publicly did
not tend to enhance the movement at the time, alienating
as it did some amount of public sympathy. The honesty of
purpose of the Postmaster-General was generally recognised,
and his rebuke, coupled with an unequivocal promise to do
them justice within reasonable time, somewhat restrained the
more ardent among the agitators. The reflection that this
blind philosopher and statesman was grappling with an immense
difficulty and a complicated problem, affecting thousands
of others besides telegraphists, demanding time, patience,
insight, and judgment, at last sobered their impatience. For
the most part they came to acknowledge they had been too impetuous,
though a number regarded the reproof as unmerited.</p>

<p>Mr. Fawcett kept his promise honourably, and on June 18,
1881, his scheme for improved pay and revised classification,
covering both the telegraph and postal sides of the service,
was issued. It was then seen how stupendous must have
been his task. While a threatening and angry crowd without
were demanding immediate redress, he was now patiently and
busily preparing proposals for their contentment, and now
battling with the Treasury on their behalf, and to get those
proposals accepted. He had accomplished a great task, and
in the circumstances the telegraphists felt that deep gratitude
was due to him. As he had been the very first to deal with
the postal side of the question from a truly statesmanlike
point of view, so he had been the first to approach the telegraphist
difficulty in the same manner. The application of
the Fawcett scheme to the telegraphists brought them immediate
and material benefits, and gave them a status and a
better-defined position as Government servants. The defects
of the late Scudamore scheme were greatly diminished, but,
needless to say, the improved scale of pay was even better
appreciated than the improved prospects of promotion, while
a more equitable rate of payment for overtime, and a reduction
of night attendance to seven hours, payment for
Christmas Day and Good Friday, constituted the more acceptable
features of Mr. Fawcett’s measure for the telegraphists.</p>

<p>The concessions brought to them by the Fawcett scheme
were evidently the result of much hard work and strong endeavour
on Mr. Fawcett’s part. Every one felt that he had been
animated by an honest desire to fairly meet them, and for such
endeavours and such desire on his part they expressed their
gratitude and thanks. But at the same time it was universally
felt that he had to a great extent been balked in his intention
to accord them full justice. They were sincerely grateful to
him for his manly and honest treatment of their demands;
but they knew that Mr. Fawcett’s hands were tied, that his
liberty of action was circumscribed, and that what he had
obtained for them had been strenuously contended for and
grudgingly conceded. In high quarters the scheme was regarded
as a generous one all round, and it is perhaps doubtful
that the recommendations of Mr. Fawcett, if made by a lesser
man and other than a Professor of Political Economy, would
have been entertained and accepted. So that, in so far as it
fell short of meeting their demands, they blamed Mr. Fawcett<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
less than an unkind fate and the permanent officialdom in
league with a suspicious and parsimonious Treasury.</p>

<p>As it was, however, they might have been prepared to
accept the few flies in the ointment but for their discerning a
disposition on the part of the authorities to whittle down at
every opportunity the most acceptable and valued concessions
contained in the scheme. Next to the improved wage-scales,
perhaps one of the most highly-prized boons it gave them was
that of reducing the night duty from eight to seven hours.
But it had scarcely been conceded ere it was filched back
from them with the declaration that “night” only meant from
10 <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span> to 5 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span> The ungenerous spirit in which the benefits
of the Fawcett scheme were applied to the telegraphists taught
them to examine into their bargain a little more closely. The
result was they found many things wanting, and the absence
of which convinced them that they were justified in continuing
the agitation. It was acknowledged that Mr. Fawcett intended
to place them on an equality with the postal staff in the matter
of preferment, but it was contended that it was not done. It
was pointed out that there was an apparent similarity of wages,
but that it was more apparent than real. While it was admitted
that Mr. Fawcett’s evident intention was to confer lasting
benefits on both branches of the service, events would
show that his retention of the discredited system of classification
meant leaving to his successors a legacy of strife between
them and their subordinates. Failing as the Fawcett scheme
did to entirely eradicate the malignant growth of classification
introduced by Mr. Scudamore, this scheme could not be
accepted as a permanent remedy. By its operation, it was
maintained, their rightful increments towards the maximum
would be artificially arrested by class barriers. The effect
would be to bar them from attaining a reasonable wage within
a reasonable time, and they declared that they better required
a present living wage than the far-off prospect of reaching
£400 a year at the moment of being forced through old age
to retire from the service. Such a “prospect” was nothing
more than a cruel <i lang="la">ignis fatuus</i> while this delusive system of
classification was sustained.</p>

<p>One curious result of the Fawcett scheme was that the telegraphists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
declared that they were not placed on an equality
with the postal side, as was intended by the spirit and letter
of it, while the postal agitators a little later adopted similar
arguments to prove that they had not been placed on an
equality with the telegraphists, as was also intended.</p>

<p>Dissatisfaction with their position in the service, despite the
late scheme, gradually became acute once more among the
telegraphists. On July 17, 1881, one month from the issuing
of Mr. Fawcett’s intended remedy and stop-gap for further
agitation, a conference held at Liverpool resolved that a permanent
organisation covering the whole of the United Kingdom
was an absolute necessity to prevent further encroachments
upon them and to preserve what little they had already gained.
December 3, 1881, saw the Postal Telegraph Clerks’ Association
launched into existence. Immediately from all over the
country support was forthcoming, the greater part of the provincial
offices rallying round the standard set up at Liverpool.</p>

<p>Mr. Fawcett, as may be imagined, was not pleased at the
manner in which his well-intended scheme was received by
the telegraphists, but he met all criticism and all opposition
with that unflinching courage of the philosopher which was
his chiefest trait. An utterance made by him at this period,
when speaking at Hackney, November 2, 1881, affords an
interesting glimpse into his mind on this question. On that
occasion he said, “All experience shows that the sense of
wrong remains long after a grievance has been redressed and
an injustice remedied.”</p>

<p>Whether or not the grievances had been redressed and
the injustices remedied, as he honestly intended they should
be so far as lay in his power, certainly the original sense of
wrong was to remain long afterwards. This surviving sense
of wrong, Mr. Fawcett probably hoped, would gradually die
out as his remedy applied its healing balm. But it was to
survive longer than he anticipated, and to be fostered till it
developed into almost a passionate outburst which, in a few
years to come, another equally great and strong man, Mr.
Raikes, had eventually to calm and temporarily check by yet
another measure of relief.</p>

</div>

<p>As there was a long period of inactivity and stagnation between
the period of the cruel dismissals in 1874 and the introduction
of the Fawcett scheme, so among the letter-sorters there followed
another such period after 1881. This time the period of stagnation
lasted nearly seven years. During that seven years or
more, the service had relapsed into much about the same
condition as prevailed before Mr. Fawcett took office. But
for the slightly better rate of pay, the increase on the maximum
and an increased holiday for the senior men only, the
state of things was little better, if any, than twenty years
previous. The men had no organisation to safeguard their
interests, and consequently were more or less at the mercy of
minor officials who very often did not scruple to take advantage
of their helpless condition. That the indoor staffs on
the postal side of the service should have drifted into this,
that their very lack of combination should have courted the
over-zealous attentions of the minor authorities, is not to be
wondered at. Still less is it to be wondered at that their interests
were neglected; that privileges were lost sight of where
they were not openly filched from them; and that sporadic
and individual attempts to obtain redress remained unnoticed
and went unheard.</p>

<p>The monotony of this period was occasionally broken only
by the appearance of some criticism of Post-Office administration,
or of the petty tyranny of the lower officials, appearing
in one or two papers which pretended to have espoused the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
cause of the men. Two of these papers circulated principally
in the gutter. One was the notorious <cite>Town Talk</cite>, which from
time to time printed several ably-written articles on Post-Office
treatment of its employés. Had they appeared elsewhere than
in its too-spicy pages, they might have commanded more attention
and carried more conviction of their sincerity. Another
was an appropriately-named print called the <cite>Rag</cite>, sold at a
halfpenny, and with which for the brief period of its existence
there was associated a lately-resigned sorter, who, from a knowledge
of his own cruel experiences in the General Post-Office,
either wrote or inspired the bitter and vulgar paragraphs which,
with pointed personality, were aimed for the most part at the
minor supervisors, who were represented as acting the part of
bullies and petty tyrants towards their helpless underlings.
The <cite>Rag</cite> and <cite>Town Talk</cite>, however, came to an untimely end,
and, so far as their peculiar advocacy of the postal cause went,
perhaps it was as well. The Post-Office employés were in
such an oppressed state that they were ready to welcome any
criticism almost that was supposed to be aimed at their taskmasters.
But though such criticisms were read with some
amount of interest by many, they gratified very few, while with
many they disgusted more than they interested.</p>

<p>There was also started soon afterwards another belonging to
this class of ephemeral journalism, but of somewhat better tone
and character, an East-End local organ called <cite>Toby</cite>, which,
during 1886, dealt week after week with Post-Office abuses.
<cite>Toby</cite> was supposed to have some additional claim on the
patronage of postal servants by its being edited by a man who
had once been behind the scenes in the Post-Office. It enlivened
its more or less pointed criticisms with rough caricatures
of certain of the so-called petty tyrants who were supposed to
float on human misery; but the simulated and insincere malice
of the caricatures was, fortunately for the intended originals,
almost completely lost in the quality of the art. <cite>Toby</cite> for a
time flourished in the gutters of St. Martin’s-le-Grand, and sold
in the streets about the City, but it was principally while the
caricatures lasted to afford the amusement and excitement of
guessing competitions among the sorters and letter-carriers
of the General Post-Office. When the caricatures gave out,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
and there were no more guesses as to who was meant as the
latest victim of the new Hogarth’s pencil, the star of <cite>Toby</cite>
waned in St. Martin’s-le-Grand.</p>

<p>Advocacy of this nature, such as it was, did no more than
cause annoyance and irritation to those who found a ready
means to visit reprisals on the men whom they might suspect
of being the secret instigators of such insults, while among the
men it only satisfied an idle curiosity. Yet the men undoubtedly
would have welcomed some proper medium to ventilate
their growing grievances. The <cite>Postman</cite>, which had been
started as the organ of a previous agitation, was long since
defunct, and a copy of the <cite>Beehive</cite> was now almost a relic of
ancient history. It was in response to this growing necessity
for discontent to once more find utterance that a new postal
organ started. It was called the <cite>Postal and Telegraph Service
Gazette</cite>, and was contributed to by both sides of the service.
It was admirably edited, and from the pens of the ablest
writers among the telegraphists and the postal force some
stirring articles occasionally appeared. It afterwards became
the <cite>Postal Service Gazette</cite>. These new ventures in postal
journalism provided a healthy outlet for the pent-up discontent
of years. The articles were generally ably written and forcible,
but there was not too much personality allowed in the letters
from correspondents with a grievance. These organs helped
in no inconsiderable measure to shape the course of future
events, and, while promoting a spirit of freedom among postal
servants, gave it a healthy and manly tone.</p>

<p>Still, even with the help of these organs, there was not yet
a properly-organised movement either among the letter-sorters
or the letter-carriers. Their recovery from the unmerited
onslaught of Lord John Manners, and the effacement of the
memory of it, was slow.</p>

<p>But, as is inevitably the case in the same set of circumstances,
the harvest was sowing: there was a repetition of the
same grumblings, and all the elements of discontent were once
more developing. Gradually the old impositions as regards
compulsory extra duty were being introduced; the men’s time
counted for little or nothing, and their convenience as little.
The Fawcett scheme had laid it down expressly that Christmas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
Day and Good Friday should be paid for as extra duty, but
the whole recommendation, if not rendered nugatory altogether,
was applied in a very unsatisfactory manner.</p>

<p>Christmas morning 1886 was nearly witnessing one of those
disgraceful rushes for the doors which had taken place on
several occasions some years previously. The sorting force
had been on duty all through the preceding night, and a long
time before many indeed had been working the round of the
clock. The men were dead beat, and they had been promised
their liberty at nine o’clock. Perhaps there would have been
nothing very unreasonable in the request that they should
work a few hours longer, had it not been that they had to be
back again on duty in the afternoon. But they had experienced
this kind of treatment too many times before; and
when the clock struck the welcome hour of nine they left the
sorting-tables and made to leave the office. Christmas extra
duty at this time was looked on with aversion by the most of
them, for, as an actual fact, the money they earned on that
occasion, they knew, would not be paid them for three or
four months to come. Every branch in the office, especially
the Inland Letter Branch, was choked with work from floor to
ceiling. But the men were eager to get home to snatch a few
hours’ rest. Once more they found all the exits closed and
bolted against them; and they stood about in sullen groups
considering what was best to be done. Mr. Jeffery, the
then Controller, who had a reputation for great kindliness
and consideration, came on the scene and appealed to the
men to clear up the duty. He asked them why they refused
to work when the department was willing to pay them so well.
There was no response for a few moments, when a youngster
named Groves up and spoke to the great man, and told him
that it was because they had to wait so long for the money;
and pointed out that the Christmas extra-duty money the
previous year was not paid till the middle of the following
summer; and offered an assurance that if the money were
quickly paid the men would doubtless be willing to stop.
The Controller, it appeared, had not been aware of this senselessly-unfair
cause of delay.</p>

<p>He readily gave his promise that if the correspondence were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
all cleared up before the morning was over, he would see that
the money should be paid as speedily as possible, and that a
special staff of men would be employed to get the account out.
There was a cheer, and every one started work. The extra-duty
money was paid within a fortnight, and was afterwards paid
as quickly.</p>

<p>It was such petty annoyances and such instances of neglect
as these, so long continued, that at last began to awaken the
men to a fuller sense of their grievances, and which once more
fostered the desire for combination amongst them. In addition
to this, too, the idea was gaining ground that they were being
systematically cheated out of benefits which the Fawcett scheme
entitled them to. Now that he was dead, Mr. Fawcett was
more than ever regarded as the postal Moses, and they looked
for a clearer interpretation of the tablets of the law which he
had left behind to help to build his monument.</p>

<p>The new desire for combination at first only asserted itself
in a somewhat feeble manner when it became known that a
Royal Commission on Civil Establishments would be likely to
look in at the doors of the Post-Office. It was then for the
first time after so long that a few of the more venturesome
banded themselves together for the purpose of collecting and
tabulating suitable evidence on postal grievances generally,
and for working up the interest of the men affected. Of this
little committee J. H. Williams was chairman, and W. E. Clery
was secretary. These two sorters, the latter especially, were
destined to play a more important part in agitation later on.</p>

<p>The Commission on Civil Establishments had been moved
for and obtained by Lord Randolph Churchill, and it was
confidently expected that it would take evidence from the
Post-Office employés. An invitation had appeared in a
Post-Office Circular of December 1886 for postal servants to
prepare evidence, if any, to lay before the Royal Commission.
Consequently there were several meetings held, and representatives
of almost every branch of the service on the postal
side were present at these meetings, comprising sorters, letter-carriers,
porters, bagmen, and even clerks and members of the
major establishment, who were as anxious to make their case
heard. A stupendous amount of evidence was thus got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
together and properly prepared. But though an enormous
amount of labour was thus expended on the accumulated
grievances of so many years, it was all love’s labour lost, and
never got beyond this stage. They sustained another disappointment,
added to so many others, and learnt that the
promised Royal Commission was not intended to come their
way, but had concluded its labours. There was nothing left
but for the postal committee to disband likewise, which they
did with feelings of disappointment, which went to feed still
further the smouldering discontent among the men. They
felt they had been deliberately fooled by the department in
being thus invited to prepare evidence which was to be wasted.
Yet it was far from wasted, and the lesson had a real educational
value, and one which was to bear fruit a little later on.
The little experience, though fraught with disappointment,
had none the less taught them the better to prepare their
weapons for a future occasion.</p>

<p>At this time, if anything there was more real discontent
among the juniors of the sorting staff than among the seniors.
The greatest dissatisfaction prevailed among them mainly
owing to the lack of promotion, for the sorting force being
divided into two classes, first and second, the juniors had to
remain at a certain barrier until a vacancy occurred in the
class above them. They virtually had little but the hope of
waiting for dead men’s shoes. This system of promotion was
becoming utterly discredited, owing to the fact that while the
juniors’ class was practically unlimited in number, that of the
seniors was limited, and by no means in fair proportion. The
average of deaths and pensions among their elders afforded a
prospect only to the merest section of their number. It was
maintained by them that the only fair remedy was the substitution
of promotion by service, and not by death or pension.
Five years, it was urged, was a fair period of service to entitle
them to promotion to the class above them, and a movement
was soon on foot to submit their proposal to the Postmaster-General.
They were the young bloods of the service, and new
blood had brought new courage and new vigour. Their case,
carefully prepared, had been awaiting the arrival of the expected
Royal Commission which never came. They in consequence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
resolved—or rather the youth who led them did, the
same W. E. Clery who had acted as secretary of the late
abortive Royal Commission movement—to effect what they
could in amelioration of their position by using the readiest
means to hand. Mr. Raikes was now Postmaster-General,
and from all that had reached them of his justice and impartiality,
they were inspired with a desire to go forward. It
was thought that from every point of view this resolve was a
wise one, as should another Royal Commission after all be
ready to accept their evidence, and it was learnt that they had
failed to petition the Postmaster-General, it might be urged
that the hardship of a lack of promotion was one specially
manufactured to suit the occasion, since nothing had before
been heard of it. So there was a preliminary meeting of the
juniors held in the largest refreshment-room of the General
Post-Office, and a bigger meeting was held in the same place
a few days later, when a draft of the proposed petition was
read and discussed. In the following month, September 1887,
the second-class men’s petition was forwarded. This petition,
to the Postmaster-General direct, was memorable if only from
the fact that it was the first petition worth speaking of, the
outcome of a general meeting, which had been forwarded to
the public head of the department since the day when Lord
John Manners dismissed five and punished over a hundred
of others practically for the same thing. The petition forwarded
on the present occasion expressed in no unmistakable
language that the men were unqualifiedly dissatisfied with the
system of promotion by vacancy made by pension or death in
the ranks of their seniors, and pointed out that, young men as
the petitioners were, yet the most of them would be superannuated
before their turn for promotion came. It was conveyed
to the Postmaster-General for the first time by means
of this memorial that the provisions of the Fawcett scheme
had not been fully given effect to. Now, one of the most
marked features of the 1881 scheme was that the remuneration
of postal employés should be “based upon the intelligible
principle of paying for work solely according to its quality.”
It was urged therefore by these juniors, who so commonly
were put to perform higher-class duties for their scanty wage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
that their responsibilities should be recognised on the principle
laid down by Mr. Fawcett. The petition concluded with a
respectful request that, if the Postmaster-General required a
further explanation on any particular point, he would receive
a deputation of their body. There were two months of silence
and waiting. Then in January 1888 permission was obtained
to hold another meeting in the refreshment-room, the meeting
being called by the youth Clery to consider what further steps
should be taken to obtain an answer.</p>

<p>Clery had by this time practically assumed the leadership
of the young men’s movement, and though but a mere stripling,
displayed from the first, in a very marked degree, qualities
of leadership far beyond his years. He was a tall, pale-faced
youth, with a rapidity and a fluency of utterance, tipped with a
musical brogue, that at once betrayed his Hibernian nationality;
a decisiveness of thought and action, united to a method of
close reasoning, that at once charmed, convinced, and astonished.
He was just the spirit and the calibre to set down
in the midst of a few hundred young fellows sore about
their unredressed grievances, and he obtained their confidence
without asking for it.</p>

<p>It was resolved at this meeting that a deputation should
wait upon the Permanent Secretary, Sir Arthur Blackwood;
but in answer to their request for an interview it was curtly
intimated to them that their memorial had been duly considered
by the Postmaster-General, that he could not comply
with their request, nor did he see any good in granting the
interview asked for. By some means Clery got the answer so
as to keep it to himself till the last moment, but by it he was
decided to call another general meeting that same evening.
There were such whisperings and a pretence at mystery on
Clery’s part that expectation was roused to the highest pitch,
and a few minutes after eight o’clock the meeting-room was
crammed almost to suffocation. Not since the days of the
movement twelve or fourteen years before had such enthusiasm
prevailed among a meeting assembled within the precincts of
the General Post-Office. The silence of fourteen years was
broken, and, like the cheers of a beleaguered garrison who see
the relief expedition within sight, the shouts of the crowded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
meeting testified to the new hope that had been aroused by
the announcement that their petition “held the field.” The
convener and chairman of the meeting, Clery, had in his discursive
and picturesque fashion gone over every single point
of the petition which had been forwarded, and at last, after a
rhetorical pause, he announced that he had received a reply
which justified him making the declaration that the “petition
held the field.” This phrase became memorable to some
extent from that moment because of the electrical effect and
the enormous enthusiasm it momentarily produced. But it
amounted to nothing more than a subtle trick of rhetoric on
the part of the speaker, the success of which was not wholly
effaced even by the subsequent disappointment when they
learnt that the Postmaster-General had met their demands
with an unequivocal refusal on every point. Their petition
held the field only in so far as that not a single reason had
been advanced against it. The feeling of mingled anger and
disappointment which had taken possession of the meeting
immediately after Clery’s announcement was quickly turned to
one of determination to press their claims still further despite
the official rebuff. Another petition was forthwith prepared
asking for a reconsideration of the various points, but this met
with no better fate.</p>

<p>The guns of the second-class movement were thus silenced,
and as a sectional agitation the movement itself soon afterwards
fell through. But it was not to die in the ordinary
sense that sectional movements usually do die. It simply
transferred its energies and its resources into a wider field.
The conviction had been growing among all grades of the
sorting force that they all had grievances in common, and the
one that demanded their united action was the manner in
which certain benefits of the Fawcett scheme had been persistently
withheld. It was therefore decided to combine forces
and unite in common action, the juniors and the seniors alike
in one camp. This wider fraternal feeling between the first
and the second class of sorters was principally brought about
by the discovery by Williams—a sorter who had diligently been
investigating the matter—of a copy of the full and original text
of the much-disputed scheme itself. It seemed to have escaped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
observation that the text of this document had been printed in
the public press at the time of its introduction, and that it had
also been printed as a Parliamentary paper, which might have
been procured in the ordinary way with very little trouble had
they only thought of it. It is, however, a somewhat curious
fact to be remembered that for some reason or other it was
thought printed Parliamentary and official papers relating to
the Post-Office were unobtainable, and that postal officials, to
get a glimpse of them at all, must do so secretly and surreptitiously.
There was a feeling that one might only purchase them
by proxy, while they waited out of sight with fear and trembling
lest their criminal intention should be suspected by some
prowling Post-Office spy dogging their footsteps. This was
the kind of feeling which indeed had governed most of the
actions of postal servants for the previous ten years or so, and
doubtless this timid reluctance to be seen reading or seeking
to obtain printed official documents by the light of day was a
survival and a result of the long serfdom to which they had
been reduced.</p>

<p>Yet like most dangers this was more shadowy than real, and
there was no reason why a man should not, if he were so
minded, have ordered this particular Parliamentary paper
through his newsagent, or gone boldly to the counter of the
Government printers and, putting down his few pence,
demanded to be served with a copy. Furthermore, there was
perhaps as little reason why a postal servant should not be
seen openly reading such a document within the precincts
of the Post-Office itself. He might have cheaply gained a
character for boldness had he but known it. But Williams,
who first set himself to bring the mysterious document to
light, though he shared the original belief about the exclusiveness
of this particular class of literature, was made of different
stuff, and entered on his quest like one equipped for an expedition
into unknown regions. Probably he was disappointed
that he met with so few difficulties. The simple purpose was
invested with a dramatic interest from the start.</p>

<p>Williams, though he was not weak enough to lose the
opportunity for surrounding his exploit with the necessary
amount of mystery to enable him to pose as the one man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
on earth to whom the gods had been kind in vouchsafing
him the ownership of the sacred screed, yet, nevertheless,
if the truth has to be told, came into its possession in the
most ordinary prosaic fashion. But the moral courage of him
who was thus determined to brave the unknown terrors of
publishers’ rebuffs and awkward official inquiries was none
the less real, nor was the document itself when so cheaply
obtained any the less valuable.</p>

<p>Williams was undoubtedly a man of grit, of indomitable
perseverance, combining the qualities of an attorney with
the cold-blooded zeal and high-minded courage of a Puritan
of old. The suggestion of the Puritan in his manner was
accentuated by a tantalising slowness of utterance even in the
moments of highest expectancy, and when his audience felt
and knew he had something rich to offer them.</p>

<p>Williams the original discoverer, and the chosen few whom
he took into his confidence, hugged their precious document
close for a considerable time, withdrawing themselves now
and again to little out-of-the-way and unguessed-at meeting-places
to distil from it the honey drops which they judiciously
from time to time sprinkled among the thirsty multitude of
their followers.</p>

<p>It was the knowledge of this discovery and that new
leaders had been born to them that tended to erase the class
differences between the senior and the junior men, uniting
them once and for all in a common purpose and under one
standard. This was brought to a culmination on April 18,
1889, when, for the first time since the memorable meeting
called by Booth, a former agitator, a huge gathering of postal
servants of every grade and class met in one of the disused
rooms of the Parcel Depot of St. Martin’s-le-Grand. There
had been other meetings within the building, but not till now
had every class and every branch been represented on the
platform and among those in front. The occasion was noteworthy
as being the first after so many years on which the
classes had met to unite on a common basis, and as therefore
being representative of the entire postal staff of the Chief
Office. The previous meeting in the refreshment bar had
whetted the appetite of the younger men, and a new courage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
permeated all ranks; for they discerned the dawn of a new
era. The two principal leaders and expounders of their
discontent were already become as apostles of right and truth.
It was Clery for the younger, the more ambitious and the
more spirited among the sorting force; it was Williams for
the elder, the plodding, the painstaking, the cautious. It was
Clery for the dashing, audacious manœuvre; it was Williams
for the certain, slow, and sure.</p>

<p>Williams was voted into the chair by acclamation, and from
that moment wore the epaulettes of an officer and a recognised
leader. The Fawcett scheme of 1881 was henceforth to be
accepted as their banner, their charter, and their palladium;
and with that in their midst they determined to march to victory,
and wherever their leaders should direct. Williams, in
his careful, painstaking, lawyer-like manner, expounded the
scheme they had met to discuss, and showed to their entire
satisfaction that the recommendations of the late Mr. Fawcett
had not been applied to them; and that certain things mentioned
in the bond having so long been withheld from them,
it was their duty to themselves and those coming after them in
the service to see that they got all that they were thereby
entitled to. There was the tremendous enthusiasm usual with
those newly awakened to a sense of their long-suffering, and
the realisation of things they were yet entitled to have and to
hold. There was much determination expressed, but as yet
no plan to proceed upon. It was a great meeting, a splendid
cohesion of kindred particles too long held asunder, but as yet
there was no proposition before them. Then it was that young
Clery stepped into the breach, and proposed the heroic method
of ignoring the postal officials by addressing a protest to Parliament,
or lying right away to the Lords of the Treasury.
After their experience with the Postmaster-General, Mr. Raikes,
petitions and protests addressed to him were regarded as having
no more effect than paper-pellets. If ever a Postmaster-General
came in for a rough handling in his own household,
Mr. Raikes did on this occasion. The meeting eventually
decided on petitioning the Controller of the London postal
service for the full benefits of the Fawcett scheme, and pledged
itself to forward a similar petition to the Lords of the Treasury<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
in the event of meeting with unfavourable replies from the
Controller and Postmaster-General. Probably no one candidly
believed that such a petition would have any more effect
than former paper-pellets of similar nature; but it was very
necessary as a preliminary stage in the opening of the campaign.
A committee, selected from eager candidates, was formed
therefore to draw up the terms of a joint petition. The proposal
had been much too modest for Clery, who vigorously
recommended taking higher ground, and dealing with Parliament
direct; but he was now induced to consent to become
one of the number henceforth to be known as the Fawcett
Scheme Committee. The sorting force as a body had thrown
in its lot together; there was to be no more class distinction,
the whole contained the lesser; there were to be no more petty
rivalries, no more internecine, branch, or sectional differences—not
until next time. They were confident they had touched
solid ground at last. If this their last appeal to Cæsar proved
of no avail, then they would appeal beyond Cæsar, to the
Treasury and the public.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<p>WORK OF THE FAWCETT SCHEME COMMITTEE—A NOTABLE
PAMPHLET—MR. RAIKES AND THE “AGITATOR”—A NEW
POSTAL ORGAN—THE FAWCETT SCHEME AND THE
“LUMINOUS COMMITTEE.”</p>

</div>

<p>The seed had germinated; the plant had taken root even in
such seemingly stony and barren soil, and was destined within
a short while, despite chill winds and frost-bite, to become
flourishing and fruitful.</p>

<p>The newly-constituted Fawcett Scheme Committee set about
in real earnest in preparing the further petition which should
suitably represent the united claims of the two classes. As
the representatives of the first and second classes of sorters,
they called attention to the fact that several important provisions
of the scheme of reorganisation, recommended by the
late Mr. Fawcett when Postmaster-General, and sanctioned by
the Treasury in 1881, had not been carried into effect; and
on behalf of the sorters, they wished to take such steps as may
be in their power to have those provisions effectuated. The
improvements of position which had been sanctioned by the
Treasury, and which, they submitted, they had been entitled
to since April 1, 1881, were comprised in the sanctioned
recommendation of Mr. Fawcett to redress the grievances
coming under the first two of the five points to which, in his
letter to the Treasury, he reduced the whole of the representations
and petitions which had been addressed to him by the
various classes of the postal and telegraph services, viz.:—</p>

<p>“1. Inadequacy of pay arising to some extent from stagnation
in promotion.</p>

<p>“2. The excessive amount of overtime, the small rate of
pay allowed for it, and the severity of the night duty. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
inadequacy of pay referred to in the first point was redressed
by a new classification and scale of wages, which was to be
uniform for the postal staff of the Sorting Branch and for the
telegraphists (<i lang="la">vide</i> Treasury reply), and which was ‘based upon
the intelligible principle of paying for work solely according to
its quality’ (<i lang="la">vide</i> Mr. Fawcett’s report to the Treasury).”</p>

<p>The grievances embodied in the second point were redressed
by the recommendation in paragraphs 5 and 6 of Mr.
Fawcett’s report, viz.:—</p>

<p>“5. That the period of ordinary night attendance, both for
telegraphists and sorting clerks, be reduced from eight to seven
hours; already recognised at several offices as the proper
amount of night attendance for the postal staff.</p>

<p>“6. That payment as for overtime work at provincial offices,
whether of telegraphists or sorting clerks, be, in the case of
male officers, at the rate of one-fiftieth part of a week’s pay
per hour, and in the case of female officers (who, as a rule, are
not called upon to do more than 48 hours’ work per week)
at the rate of one-forty-eighth part of a week’s pay. That
when the overtime at any given office on a single occasion
exceeds three hours, the rate of pay for such excess shall be
one-quarter higher than the ordinary rate. As a rule the 16
hours which form an officer’s work for two days shall be so
divided as to avoid giving him more than 11 hours’ work on
either day; when an occasional exception is necessary, all
excess beyond 11 hours in any one day shall be paid for as
overtime, although the two days’ work in the aggregate may
not exceed 16 hours.”</p>

<p>The petition proceeded to point out that:—</p>

<p>“None of these provisions have been carried into effect.
The scale of wages under which we are paid should, as stated
in the Treasury reply, be uniform with that of the Central
Telegraph Office, which is detailed in Schedule B in the copy
of the papers ordered to be printed by the Honourable the
House of Commons. Nor is work paid for according to its
quality, as sorters of the second class are regularly required to
perform duties of the highest quality, and consequently appertaining
to the first class. On this point we hold that a hard
and fast limitation of the classes within certain prescribed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
numbers is opposed to Mr. Fawcett’s recommendation, and
therefore not in accordance with the letter or spirit of this reorganisation
scheme sanctioned by the Lords of the Treasury;
for it is clearly explained, that the paying for such work solely
according to its quality is to be effected by regulating the
‘number of places’ in the class carrying any particular scale,
‘strictly in accordance with the aggregate number’ of duties
appertaining to that class. The number of places in the class
carrying the first-class scale should, consequently, be limited
solely by the number of first-class duties.</p>

<p>“The recommendation to reduce the night duty to seven
hours has not been carried out, as in the N.P.B. and
I.B. a duty exists extending from 5 <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span> to 12.30 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span>,
and in the E.C.D.O. there is in existence a duty extending
from 4 <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span> until 12 midnight. We are aware that
a portion of these duties comes within the hours of the
ordinary evening attendance, but in the case of a midnight
duty of seven hours (say from 12 midnight to 7 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span>),
a certain portion also comes within the hours of the equally
ordinary morning attendance, and we therefore contend that
the duties we have mentioned come within the reference of
the scheme of midnight duties, and should not therefore
exceed seven hours.</p>

<p>“We need not point out that overtime is not paid for in
accordance with the recommendation of the scheme. That
we are entitled to payment at this rate is certain, for although
the paragraph reads, ‘for ordinary overtime work at provincial
offices,’ it is expressly stated in another paragraph of the report
that the sorting force in London cannot be excluded from any
improvement of position which may be conceded to the telegraphists
and provincial sorting clerks.</p>

<p>“These are the provisions which have been expressly
sanctioned by the Treasury for our benefit, and which we
have been elected to endeavour to have carried into effect;
but we may also mention the reference in Mr. Fawcett’s report
to point 3 respecting holidays, viz.:—‘I am now considering
a scheme the effect of which I hope may be to give
one month’s leave in the course of the year to many who now
have only three weeks, and three weeks to many who now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
have only a fortnight, respecting which we have been instructed
to inquire, if the order of the Postmaster-General in the Post-Office
Circular of 30th November 1886 is the effectuation of
Mr. Fawcett’s contemplated scheme, and, if so, to ascertain if
the fortnight’s leave of absence enjoyed by the second class
should not be extended as in the case of the first class to three
weeks. We are also instructed to inquire what foundation
exists for the prevalent impression, that the payment as for
overtime work given for all work done on Christmas Day and
Good Friday should be at the rate of pay for overtime work
on Sundays, and not on week days.</p>

<p>“We think it the most courteous and respectful method
we could adopt to bring these facts under your notice, and
before taking any further steps to ask you for any information
on these points which may be within your knowledge,
and for guidance as to the methods we should pursue,
which, while fulfilling the trust reposed in us by our brother
officers, would meet with your commendation. In conclusion,
we beg to press on your consideration the fact that this is a
representation emanating from the entire sorting staff of the
Circulation Department, who feel sure that some of the most
important provisions granted to them by the Lords of the
Treasury have been withheld from them since 1881, and that
you will therefore be kind enough to regard this letter as a
matter of urgency, and favour us with an immediate intimation
of its having reached you, and a reply at your earliest convenience.”</p>

<p class="right">[Signed by the Committee.]</p>

<p>This petition from the united classes of the London sorting
force broadly covered the whole of the ground on which they
based their claims to the Fawcett scheme, and the various
other petitions presented to Mr. Raikes were modelled upon
it. As was almost inevitable under the circumstances, and
as was almost expected by the promoters themselves, another
unfavourable reply to their petition was received from the
Controller. It was therefore soon afterwards determined to
seek for permission, this time from the Postmaster-General himself,
to hold another general meeting inside the official building.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>In the meantime, however, Clery, the enthusiastic and
resourceful young leader of the new movement, had written
and published a pamphlet, “An Exposition of the Fawcett
Scheme,” which gained a ready sale among the interested and
expectant men. The exposition was a clever piece of literary
dissection, and a clear analysis of the much-debated question
of Mr. Fawcett’s intended meaning. With rare legal acumen
the text and spirit of the 1881 scheme were compared and
examined, and considered at some length. The conclusion
was, of course, favourable to the contention that the sorting
force were still being robbed of their rightful privileges.</p>

<p>The audacity of openly and undisguisedly rushing into print
in the face of what were supposed to be most hard and fast
regulations against it, caused in the minds of many no little
anxiety as to the safety of the author. There were even some
protests from the committee, and at least one resignation. But
the men as fully appreciated the necessity of some explanatory
information on the subject as did the writer, and almost every
one possessed himself of a copy, if only to try and discern
through the chink in the door of the treasure-chamber what
proportion of the promised treasure should be his, and to
speculate as to his chances of getting it in the sweet by-and-by.
The pamphlet undoubtedly did good, and had no
inconsiderable educational value, while it strengthened the
conviction that their cause was a just one, and their course
a safe one. The recent general meeting at which it was
thought that every one had arrived at a perfect understanding
had left much to be desired in the way of information,
and the majority came away from that meeting with as varied
and divergent opinions as if a text of Scripture had been
under discussion. It was indeed only to be expected. It is
a peculiar quality of the human mind that the more a given
printed text is discussed and debated the less definite is the
understanding upon it. There is scarcely a paragraph in the
daily newspaper as to the literal and actual meaning of which
a heated discussion, and possibly sectarian differences, could
not centre upon. There had been all sorts of rumours bandied
about and opinions expressed about this wonderful scheme,
till at last, while every one agreed to believe that it was next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
to divinely inspired and that the spirit of the dead lawgiver
still hovered about it, very distinct differences prevailed as
to the meaning and bearing of particular paragraphs. Every
man had his own pet paragraph, and wore it about his
person in his waistcoat pocket or elsewhere, as a Mohammedan
wears texts of the Koran, for ready reference and the
confusion of one of opposite view. It was to meet this state
of things that Clery very sensibly conceived the idea of
supplying a long-felt want at threepence per copy.</p>

<p>The publication of this pamphlet was for the most part
thought the most daring thing that Clery had ever attempted,
especially as it was so unblushingly offered for sale within the
Post-Office itself, and under the very noses of the authorities.
None knew what would become of the man who could fly in
the face of one of the most cherished traditions of officialism;
for it had never yet been doubted that the same rules which
governed the action of “communicating with the public press”
covered such a case as this, and was sufficient to proclaim the
author an outlaw. But the writer himself, so far from acting
in ignorance of existing rules on the subject, in this very
pamphlet challenged the authority of the Postmaster-General
in this matter of personal liberty, and in one movement swept
the musty cobwebs of tradition aside. In this pamphlet it
was incidentally pointed out for the first time that there was
absolutely no prohibition against an officer of the Post-Office
being, if he chose, actually connected with the public press
while performing his official duties. The whole matter had
been immersed in obscurity; not one person in five thousand
could have quoted the rule which was supposed to overshadow
their actions in this respect. But herein for the first time it
was shown that the minute issued by the Treasury so recently
as 1875, and adopted by the Postmaster-General as a rule of
the postal service—and which had been regarded as a menace
because not understood—was directed against “Unauthorised
Communications to the Public Press of Information derived
from Official Sources.” It was scarcely likely that the rule
would be so strained in the present instance; and if it were
Clery was prepared to fight it.</p>

<p>Certain it is that Clery in no way enhanced his character in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
the service by taking up such an exposed position. His
character officially indeed had been represented as scarcely
anything to be proud of; he met with scant leniency at the
hands of those over him, and it was rumoured that his days
would not be long in the land, that is, of the postal service.
It is said that during this troublous period he was “suspended”
no less than thirteen times. Then, to the surprise of every one,
the supervising officials especially, young Clery, the agitator,
was suddenly informed that Mr. Raikes, the Postmaster-General,
had expressed a desire to see him. Such a proceeding
on the part of any former Postmaster-General was wholly
unheard of; and if it was regarded as <i lang="la">infra dig.</i> for the gilded
figurehead of a great public department to voluntarily and
unasked grant an interview to an underling so low down in
the rungs of the service, the subordinate himself was to gain a
little more credit and respect from that moment. The youth was
doing the ordinary work of the juniors at the time, and his
duty had to be provided for by the superintendent of his
branch, to enable him to gratify the Postmaster-General’s extraordinary
request for an interview with this agitating subordinate,
whose notoriety had reached the august ears. He had
but to step across St. Martin’s-le-Grand to find himself in the
presence of Mr. Cecil Raikes, and that gentleman he found
all smiles instead of all frowns, as he had been led to anticipate,
and a welcoming nod reassured him that at least the
Postmaster-General was not about to order him to be bow-strung
on the spot.</p>

<p>“I have sent for you, Mr. Clery,” said the Postmaster-General,
eyeing the stripling whose height was by no means
dwarfed by Mr. Raikes’s own six feet three or four inches,
“principally because I wanted to satisfy my curiosity. You
have such an exceptionally bad official character that it made
me curious to see what you are like.” This private interview
lasted an hour or more; and many points were discussed
between them; and from that interview it is probable that Mr.
Raikes learnt more of the actual grievances of the staff than he
might have learnt in a month through the ordinary channels,
and wading through memorials and petitions. It was the very
first time in the annals of the Post-Office that a Postmaster-General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
had invited an agitator into his presence; but it is
more than probable that Mr. Raikes had some knowledge of
the man before he met him. He must have learnt something
of his antecedents, his connections, and his character beforehand;
and when he met the youthful agitator face to face, it is
likely in a man of Mr. Raikes’s disposition that he felt some
sort of a sympathy with the ambitious and energetic youth
whose literary aspirations were to an extent a reflex of those
of his own earlier days. For Mr. Raikes himself had been an
industrious literary hand, a leader-writer for the <cite>Standard</cite>, a
poet, and a playwright. But over and above all that it is only
reasonable to think that Mr. Raikes’s principal motive was to
gather first-hand and in an informal way, from an accredited
authority, the leading agitator himself, what really were the
grievances of the postal side of the service. In selecting
Clery he selected a ready and a logical exponent of the case.
If Clery was not flattered, he certainly went away with a
better understanding of Mr. Raikes than before. His and
others’ estimate of the Postmaster-General had been based on
a misconception of him; his utterances in regard to him,
though always as respectful as the official regulations demanded,
betrayed the impression that Mr. Raikes was one of whom
they had to expect scant consideration.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Fawcett Scheme Committee were not idle,
and proceeded with the work of organising the men on a more
definite basis; voluntary subscriptions per man being collected
systematically, and the principles of trades unionism quietly
disseminated. Clery and his immediate following were now
agreed that the time had arrived when the sorting force should
set an example to other postal servants who were not yet
organised by combining on trades-union lines. The project
was privately discussed in all its bearings; meetings were held
in every available nook and corner, at Clery’s residence and
elsewhere, till at last a definite resolution was decided on, to
be moved at the next general meeting. A requisition was
sent to the Postmaster-General for the use of one of the
branches in which to hold it, and this was accompanied with
the polite request that one or two newspaper reporters might
be allowed to be present.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a rather cool request under the circumstances, and
very naturally, perhaps, Mr. Raikes at first demurred. But
eventually the little matter was negotiated; and the use of the
Foreign Newspaper Branch was given them, and reporters were
allowed to be present to take notes of the proceedings. This
was a distinct concession, which was thought to be as much
due to Mr. Raikes’s desire to be generous as to the pertinacity
of the men’s representatives. Perhaps the significance of this
little concession may be better understood when it is remembered
that the resolution which Clery and his supporters had
decided to submit at that general meeting within the Post-Office
building was to the effect, “That the time had arrived
for the sorting force to combine on trades-union principles.”</p>

<p>In moving this, reliance was doubtless placed on the fact
that previously Mr. Raikes in the House of Commons had proclaimed
his belief that civil servants had a right to combine for
mutual benefit. At this time, before it became fashionable for
Tory ministers to express such tolerant views in regard to the
claims of labour and the recognition of trades-union doctrines,
such a declaration was perhaps a little remarkable.</p>

<p>The meeting was accordingly held on December 11, 1889,
practically under the smiling patronage of the Postmaster-General,
whose action and whose judgment was to afford food
for criticism. It was the greatest gathering that had ever
assembled within the General Post-Office, far exceeding even
the one of ten or eleven years before, which had been called
by Booth the postman. The Foreign Branch, which was not
used after eight o’clock ordinarily, was on this occasion literally
packed almost to suffocation with considerably over two
thousand men of all grades. The wildfire of enthusiasm
permeated the meeting from the first moment till the last.
Men from every district office and from every branch squeezed
themselves into the place, and climbed even into the girders
of the roof, and the very weight of the enormous mass of
humanity almost constituted a grave danger, of which, however,
they were not at the time cognisant. Subsequently,
when Mr. Raikes went over the building and visited the scene
of that memorable meeting, he observed, “What! over two
thousand men here! It is a wonder the floor stood the strain.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>Overcrowded and enthusiastic as was the meeting, nothing
more serious occurred than some damage to a few sorting-tables
and the unanimous passing, amidst the wildest excitement,
of the all-important resolution. Williams was in the
chair, and in his measured, cold, metallic fashion, as a lecturer
of the Hunterian Society might, with scalpel in hand, deliver
a clinical lecture on nerve tissues and their ramifications, he
once more pulled the Fawcett scheme thread from thread.</p>

<p>The sorters were by this time pretty well acquainted with
the <i lang="la">pros</i> and <i lang="la">cons</i> of the Fawcett scheme in its application to
themselves. The proposition, therefore, that they now petition
the Postmaster-General in connection with the unfulfilled conditions
of the Fawcett scheme required but little argument to
convince them of the desirability of doing so speedily. The
second, and perhaps the more important resolution of the
two, that they now combine on trades-union lines for purposes
of mutual benefit, they were equally agreed on. Both resolutions
were carried unanimously, and it was also resolved that
the Fawcett Scheme Committee should be forthwith dissolved,
and that its members should become the provisional executive
of the new organisation, to be called the “London Sorting
Clerks’ Association.” The immediate outcome of this great
meeting was that a monster petition, embodying the points
of former petitions, was signed by the whole of the London
sorting force.</p>

<p>The Postmaster-General almost immediately this time consented
to receive a deputation of the aggrieved men at an
early date. The well-worn facts were once more refurbished,
and the necessary preparations were made to recite before
him the thrice-told tale. The deputation almost expected to
find themselves confronted by an austere, frowning official,
ready to trip them up and to limit them both in points and
minutes. But to their agreeable surprise the ogre they had
come to storm in his castle turned out to be a gentleman who
treated them with studied courtesy, who immediately put them
at their ease, telling them to feel quite at home and to sit
down with him, so that they might reason together and settle
the matter in dispute amicably and without prejudice. The
various points were urged at length by each speaker, Mr. Raikes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
meanwhile listening patiently and taking voluminous notes. At
the conclusion he turned to Clery, who was in the deputation,
and pleasantly remarked, “Now perhaps Mr. Clery will sum
up.” Nothing loth, Clery did promptly and briefly. He said
the sorters had not got the missing portion of the Fawcett
scheme, and they should never be contented or happy till they
got it, and he suggested that it should be referred to a small committee
of public men, who might satisfactorily solve the difficult
problem and interpret the scheme to every one’s satisfaction.
Mr. Raikes smiled and responded, “That is a very luminous
suggestion, Mr. Clery, and I will talk it over with the Secretary.
In the meantime, although from your point of view
your contention appears a very just one, I must say I do not
read this scheme as you do.” “Then,” said Clery, “it resolves
itself into a literary exercise.” There was some merriment
expressed, and joined in by Mr. Raikes. The Postmaster-General
further assured them that he deeply sympathised with
them in their disappointment that he did not read the scheme
as they did; but it appeared to him nevertheless that there was
a substantial equality between them and the telegraphists, who
were supposed to be so much better off. Entering more fully
on the ground of his difference with them, he pleaded that
Mr. Fawcett’s intentions could not be assumed by them, inasmuch
as the language in which they were couched was of such
an ambiguous character. Second, that the interpretation which
the permanent authorities put upon the more important passages
was directly opposite to that which the deputation
claimed to be their true meaning. Third, that at the time
the Fawcett scheme was formulated the authorities and Mr.
Fawcett understood each other, and that the arrangements at
present in existence were exactly what the late Mr. Fawcett
desired to see.</p>

<p>The deputation withdrew naturally disappointed in their
quest, but none the less impressed with the surprising difference
between their first picture of him and the man personally.</p>

<p>Following on this deputation yet another meeting within
the precincts of the General Post-Office building was asked for
and official permission obtained; and on January 16, 1890,
the combined sorting force met, again two thousand strong.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
The temper and enthusiasm of this monster gathering was if
anything more pronounced than the last, curiosity running
high as to the result of the recent meeting between their
leaders and the Postmaster-General. J. H. Williams and W.
E. Clery were the moving spirits of the platform, and the men
looked to them as the heralds of good tidings. It was resolved
that the sorting force express their regret that while the Postmaster-General
seemed to consider their view a justifiable one
and sympathised with them in their disappointment, he was
not prepared to immediately carry into effect that which had
been for so long withheld from them. He was also reminded
of the “luminous suggestion” of a “three-cornered committee”
of public men. It was decided to request that official
permission be granted for holding a further meeting in a
more convenient place, so that public men could be invited.
Further, it was definitely decided to form an organisation on
trades-union lines.</p>

<p>The want of an official organ for the interchange of ideas
among the members and for the advocacy of accepted principles
among the letter-sorting staff was at this time beginning
to be strongly felt. Clery, seeing the necessity which the new
movement had created, now determined to supply the deficiency.
At his own risk he started a small journal, the <cite>Post</cite>.
The first number appeared February 8, 1890, and was an
unpretentious, pamphlet-like little print of eight pages, sold at
a penny weekly. Clery himself was not only editor, but
almost the sole contributor; as few dared to join in the risk
of “writing for the press,” and the fact is to be commented
on only because of the surprising amount of work and responsibility
he saddled himself with at this period. Besides
performing his ordinary eight hours’ duty at the General Post-Office,
and his association as an officer with the Fawcett
Scheme Committee, and the efficient discharge of all the
detail work which such an office entailed, he was an industrious
contributor to the public press, a prolific writer of fiction, and
a playwright of some little repute. Under a <i lang="fr">nom de plume</i>
which afterwards became well known, he found an entrance
into the pages of the <cite>Gentleman’s Magazine</cite>, and found himself,
among other things, special dramatic correspondent of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
the <cite>Morning Advertiser</cite>—no mean attainments, it will be confessed,
remembering his years and the hampering conditions
under which he worked. The <cite>Post</cite> appeared, but it was predicted
by many that its life would be short, as, if it did not die
of ill-nutrition on the part of its patrons, the Postmaster-General
would undoubtedly strangle it with red-tape. But Mr. Raikes,
though he could not have been wholly oblivious to the daring
innovation in postal journalism, did not in any way attempt to
burke it, and for a considerable period it was allowed to be
sold and circulated within the precincts of the Post-Office.
Clery himself was prepared to defend his action if called on to
do so, and stoutly maintained that before the authorities could
legitimately question his right to act as the editor of a Service
paper, they would have to institute a new regulation.</p>

<p>Preparations by this time had been set afoot for the great
occasion towards which all the events of the preceding few
years had been slowly but surely trending, the formation of a
real postal trades-union. There was no attempt at disguising
the object and the nature of it; and somewhat to the surprise
of the older and more cautious among them, there was no
opposition from the authorities. Indeed, the then Controller,
Mr. R. C. Tombs, who, it may be mentioned, in his callow
youth had himself been an agitator among his own class,
seemed only too glad to remove every unnecessary official
obstacle. He offered the use of the old disused prison-chapel
at the parcel depot at Mount Pleasant for their forthcoming
inaugural meeting, and even deputed Clery and Nevill to
go there and complete arrangements. But finding it to be
scarcely suitable for the purpose, a new difficulty arose. Then
it was proposed that the postal authorities hire the Memorial
Hall, Farringdon Street, and for the time being turn it into
an official annexe, so as to meet the existing rule that meetings
might not be held outside Government buildings. This proposal
was actually seriously considered. It was then decided
by Mr. Raikes to relax the rule. By showing confidence in
the men in this matter, he thought they might be relied on
not to abuse the liberty so far accorded them. While still
retaining the right to send an official reporter, none was present,
though it was generally understood that the proceedings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
were under the espionage of known spies. It was originally
intended to call the new organisation by the name of the
“London Sorting Clerks’ Association,” but the title “sorting
clerk” being one of the minor points in dispute—it is still in
dispute—some official exception was taken to its being used
in this connection. It was then decided to rechristen it the
“Fawcett Association,” partly because it was a development of
the Fawcett Scheme Committee, and partly out of respect to the
memory of Professor Henry Fawcett, the benefactor, whose
full benefits they were endeavouring to obtain after now eight
years.</p>

<p>The new postal trades-union of letter-sorters, the Fawcett
Association, was inaugurated February 10, 1890, at the Memorial
Hall, Farringdon Street. There had been many meetings
of postal officials before, indeed much of the history of postal
agitation had been made up of meetings either open or illicit;
but this was memorable, as it marked an epoch and proclaimed
a new departure. It was the first meeting held in public by
postal servants since 1866 which had not been proscribed and
officially banned. During a previous agitation, that of 1872-74,
there had been enormous mass meetings at Cannon Street
Hotel and at Exeter Hall, and many public men of weight
and influence supported their platforms; nevertheless each of
those meetings was held in open defiance of the existing rule,
and in spite of the official warnings against them. But now
Mr. Raikes had shown his confidence in them by removing
the restriction so far as they were concerned. Henceforth
they would be free to meet when and where they liked, the
only slender link of connection between them and the Post-Office
being the presence of the official reporter. And this
right to send an official reporter to the public meetings of
postal servants was by some regarded as not wholly objectionable,
as it had the compensating advantage of providing a
ready communication between the departmental chief and
themselves. Mr. Raikes had been the first Postmaster-General
who had condescended to receive a deputation of lower subordinates
for the purpose of discussing points of difference
between them and the department. He had also been the
first to set aside an old-established rule, and to allow postal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
servants a fuller liberty to meet in places of their own selection,
where they might engage in discussion amidst more congenial
surroundings than the Post-Office could offer. Their deliberations
were henceforth not to be so cramped, cabined, and confined
as they had hitherto, but brought into the freer light of
publicity. It was a concession much to be appreciated, and
one which set a valuable precedent.</p>

<p>The indefatigable Williams presided; and once more, with
lawyer-like precision, he stated the case for the fulfilment of
the Fawcett scheme; and the numerous speakers who followed,
including Clery, drove home the necessity of forming this
association, not only for securing immediate benefits, but for
safeguarding the privileges already possessed. The result of
this inaugural meeting was that a membership of over a
thousand was immediately enrolled, and within a short time
the number was more than doubled.</p>

<p>Scarcely to be compared numerically with the former postal
trades-union, embracing the letter-carriers and letter-sorters,
which was led by Booth, the Fawcett Association was yet to
succeed as a movement where the other had failed. The
enormous movement of 1872-74, covering so wide a field as
it did, and numbering its branches in almost every town
throughout the kingdom, with great resources financially and
morally, and counting among its sponsors and supporters
dozens of the most notable men of the day, after living through
a brief and stormy period, had achieved little. The withdrawal
of the personal influence of Booth, the organising and
the dominating spirit, caused it to shrink and crumble away
in decay and disaster. It had spent thousands of pounds
one way and another, in expensive mass meetings at Exeter
Hall and elsewhere, with their bands of music and colours
flying, and public men parading their platforms in pomp;
but the agitation had produced little beyond a sensation.
The postal servants for whom the movement was begun were
left practically just where they were in the beginning. It was
an agitation which, while it ran its brief course, filled both the
public eye and ear; it bedecked itself with trappings and
tinsel; it was magnificent in a way, but directly Booth left
it, it was no longer war. He undoubtedly it was mainly who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
inspired and inflated it; and his withdrawal in a moment of
pique following indisposition, left it without a responsible
leader, and the fight became a rout. With victory almost
within sight, the principal leader withdrew and others followed,
and the rank and file of the movement, left to their own
resources, abandoned the siege and unaccountably beat a
hasty retreat, as if a panic had seized them. The very looseness
and wavering in their ranks was an invitation and an
encouragement to the official patricians who garrisoned the
till now beleaguered citadel of privilege, and directly this was
seen the cavalry issued forth and smote them. The Assyrian
came down like a wolf on the fold; and the undisciplined
and leaderless organisation had to return captive along the
paths of submissiveness and obedience. Hope for the redress
of their grievances was abandoned for years to come.</p>

<p>This, then, was the first real opportunity since the collapse
of the previous agitation that had been afforded the men of
the sorting force to reassert their liberty to organise. But
for the tact and moderation of the Postmaster-General, Mr.
Raikes, and had he been less sympathetic towards them, that
opportunity might have been still further delayed. That the
opportunity would have been sought for or forced ultimately
there can be no doubt. The younger men were not to be
expected to be intimidated by the warnings issued fifteen or
sixteen years before. That was ancient history written on a slate.
On top of the grievances left unredressed by Booth’s agitation,
others had accumulated; and none but those contented with
being born into serfdom could much longer have tolerated
or accepted such conditions. But it was due to Mr. Raikes
not only that the moment for starting a new movement was
brought nearer, but that that movement was made to run
along the constitutional and legitimate lines it did. Mr.
Raikes, unconsciously perhaps, pointed the road they should
take, and by following that direction they found the road
travelled to success. However he may have been averse to
the introduction of organised trades-unionism in the Post-Office,
Mr. Raikes took the sensible view that open and
deliberate opposition to the sorters’ agitation at that time of
day and in the circumstances would not only give a fillip to it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
but probably force it into a less commendable shape. Mr.
Raikes was a man of the world, who knew human nature and
human impulses as it showed itself in the aggregate. He
had his duty to himself, to the department, and the public
to consider, and in this instance the just motive of the man
was not inconsistent with that of the tactician. It had been
conveyed to him that there was a general storm brewing
among the telegraphists and the letter-carriers, as well as
the sorters, and he was not blind to the necessity, from a
departmental point of view, of keeping each organisation
distinct and confined to its own ground of operations. He
probably knew by this time that the sorters were sufficiently
determined to run an organisation of some kind; and failing
to prevent it, even if he would, he decided to show some
tolerance as the best means of arresting or suppressing what
might otherwise become a turbulent spirit among them. It
was under these auspices and these conditions that the
sorters’ association was inaugurated.</p>

<p>From this moment a better feeling of security and a consciousness
of strength took possession of what had hitherto
been but a loosely united crowd, and, disciplined and organised
as they now were, they felt that some material benefit
must be the outcome of their efforts. The Postmaster-General
evidently recognised that it was necessary to make some concession
to the spirit of demand everywhere manifesting itself
throughout the postal service, and shortly afterwards appointed
a small Committee of Inquiry to deal particularly with the interpretation
of the Fawcett scheme. The “luminous suggestion”
of the young leader Clery became translated into the
“Luminous Committee.” This committee, formed to assist
the Postmaster-General in determining the correct interpretation
of the much-discussed document, consisted of Sir
Francis Sandford, Sir Rupert Kettle, Q.C., Mr. William
Woodall, M.P. for Hanley, and Mr. F. J. Dryhurst, a personal
friend of the late Mr. Fawcett, as secretary. A deputation of
the staff were invited to attend the sittings, and Messrs. Williams,
Clery, Kemp, Groves, Leader, and Macartney, as representing
the men, attended and stated their case. The Fawcett
scheme, which had for so long remained a bone of contention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
over the grave of the dead benefactor, was, it seemed, at
last to be removed beyond cavil or dispute.</p>

<p>It was on this occasion that a high compliment, intentional
or unintentional, was paid to the young secretary
of the Fawcett Association, W. E. Clery, the author of the
“Exposition of the Fawcett Scheme.” The deputation had
no sooner taken their seats than the late Mr. Joyce, one of the
leading officials of the General Post-Office, handed to each a
copy of the pamphlet, though where and how they had been
obtained was something of a mystery. Not only the deputation,
but every member of the committee were provided with a
copy, and the incident occasioned no little surprise.</p>

<p>The points were discussed and the evidence given, and the
representatives of the men entertained high hopes of the matter
being speedily settled in their favour. “Waiting to hear the
verdict” became a watchword and a commonplace saying
among the men for several weeks, and few seriously doubted
what that verdict would be. On March 25, 1890, the report of
the committee was issued, and it was then found, greatly to the
surprise and disappointment of all, that the decision was against
them on every single point. There was a feeling that they
had been betrayed; but this speedily gave way to a new hope
that Mr. Raikes, after all, intended to compensate them for
the disappointment sustained; for, in the meantime, the Postmaster-General
had offered a still further compromise to the
general spirit of discontent by instituting a departmental Committee
of Inquiry to inquire fully into the quality of postal
duties. The new hope that had inspired them became
clouded with much uncertainty during the next few weeks;
but a general meeting of the men decided to await the result
a reasonable time before taking further action.</p>

<p>The verdict of the Luminous Committee was taken strong
exception to by the general body of the force as being inconclusive
and unconvincing. The official verdict, so far as
the Fawcett scheme was concerned, had gone against them
certainly, but they had lost nothing but the verdict. They lost
neither courage in themselves nor hope for the future. They
had pursued an ideal that had eluded their grasp, but it had
enticed them into pastures they might never have explored.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
It had taught them how to organise; it had taught them self-reliance,
and gave them a better appreciation of their own
value as public servants. Their pursuit of the Fawcett scheme
ideal, while it had given them some acquaintance with the
difficulties to be faced, had taught them how to surmount
those difficulties. It had inspired them with a new and a
stronger ambition to better the conditions of postal life; and
it had been the means of discovering to themselves that in
their two leaders, Clery and Williams, they had two officers of
more than ordinary ability, and to whom they could confidently
look for ultimate victory. They had lost the verdict, but this
much they had gained, and more. If nothing more substantial
had been gained from the Postmaster-General, they had
at least secured his respect and even his goodwill, and that
respect they reciprocated. At first, unwilling to consider their
claims, Mr. Raikes had come to realise that they were deadly
in earnest, and were not easy to refuse. And they had reason
to think that from this realisation had sprung the conviction
that, after all, they had grievances which, at any cost, would
have to be remedied.</p>

<p>The impression had gained ground among the leaders of
the sorters’ agitation that though the verdict had gone against
them Mr. Raikes was disposed to do all that was within his
power to improve the position and prospects of the sorting
force, on similar lines to those laid down in the Fawcett
scheme itself. The Postmaster-General was asked to receive
a further deputation from the men, and fourteen points were
submitted for his consideration, these fourteen points covering
all the ground of their previous demands. Mr. Raikes consented
to receive the deputation to discuss with him all the
points submitted with the exception of two, which were, the
reorganisation of the medical department, and the request to
have some voice in the formation of any revision before it was
finally applied. The points the Postmaster-General was asked
to discuss with the deputation were:—</p>

<p>“1. Uniform scales and privileges for the chief office of the
Sorting Branch with the Central Telegraph Office; and holidays
in accordance with the Post-Office Circular of 30th November
1886.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>“2. That the number of officers on each class be regulated
strictly in accordance with the number of duties rightly appertaining
to that class, due provision being made for lack of
promotion by the establishment of a class of seniors as in the
Central Telegraph Office; and that allowances be abolished
in favour of higher scales where duties of a higher quality are
performed, except in cases of risk or <em>temporary</em> performance
of superior duties, when the minimum of the higher scale
should be paid.</p>

<p>“3. That the minimum rate of pay for any appointed officer
of the sorting force be 24s. per week; and that the first class
be restored to the metropolitan district offices, the scale of
pay to be that of the district telegraphists.</p>

<p>“4. That officers of the sorting force may have the right of
promotion to superior appointments, especially to those dealing
directly with the control of the work.</p>

<p>“5. That in order to generally abolish ‘split’ attendances,
and reduce the extreme pressure under which the duties are
performed, a sufficient increase of the permanent staff be at
once granted.</p>

<p>“6. The abolition (1) of indirect punishment, such as the
capricious ordering of midday attendance, &amp;c. (not officially
recorded as punishment); and also (2) of confidential reports,
except in suspected criminal cases; and (3) that the notification
in the Post-Office Circular of punishment awarded to any
officer be discontinued.</p>

<p>“7. That compulsory extra duty be abolished.</p>

<p>“8. That inquiry be made into the pay, duties, and position
of the sorting staff attached to the Savings-Bank Department,
with a view of readjusting their position in the service, no
such inquiry having been made for the past seventeen years.</p>

<p>“9. That the term ‘sorting clerk’ be in all cases substituted
for that of ‘sorter.’</p>

<p>“10. That the official duty be seven hours per diem, such to
be continuous; but where a ‘split’ duty or night attendance
is necessary, six hours.</p>

<p>“11. That full pay be granted during absence on sick-leave.</p>

<p>“12. That Sunday rates be paid for all work performed on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
Christmas Day and Good Friday; all other public holidays to
be paid for at the ordinary extra-duty rates.</p>

<p>“13. That the Medical Department as at present constituted
be abolished, a medical officer being retained solely for the
examination of candidates for employment and superannuation
claimants through physical incapacity.</p>

<p>“14. That in order to render satisfactory to those concerned
any future revision we urge the necessity of our being consulted
before it assumes its final form.”</p>

<p>Early in the June following Mr. Raikes received a deputation
of six, including the indispensable Williams and Clery,
and the points were amicably discussed between them, a shorthand
writer being present. The Postmaster-General gave
every attention, and treated them as usual with consideration.
And his kindliness of nature displayed itself on this occasion
when spontaneously he made one very valuable concession
on the spot. He had been reminded that members of the
postal staffs had not yet enjoyed the privilege extended to
telegraphists, that of being transferred to country and seaside
offices when in ill health. “I should like <em>that</em> done,” said he,
turning to the Controller. And this privilege was to be enjoyed
from that moment for years to come. The business of
the deputation having concluded, the Postmaster-General complimented
them for having urged their case with great reason
and moderation, and promised he would give every consideration
to the matters laid before him; and that they might
expect an answer at as early a date as possible. Besides the
concession of temporary transfer to seaside offices in cases of
ill health, which they had gained at the interview, Mr. Raikes
had already a few days before granted full pay in sickness,
and this was now made to extend to the whole of the London
postal service. After this they had to curb their impatience
for four months, for other happenings of more serious moment
were directing Mr. Raikes’s attention elsewhere.</p>

</div>

<p>For some years after the decline of the agitation of 1872-74
the letter-carriers were practically quiescent. There was a
prolonged hiatus, not of contentment exactly, but of unvoiced
discontent, a restless slumber, with but an occasional turning
and a muttering in their sleep. It was not till 1887 that the
letter-carriers again woke to the full realisation that they were
being overburdened with an accumulation of old and new
grievances, and that the time had come to prepare for another
effort. There was the usual recrudescence of grumblings and
a groping in the semi-darkness, the usual repetition of unrecorded
back-stair and back-room meetings, some misunderstanding
as to exactly what they wanted, and which way they
should turn to get their grievances redressed. They had the
disadvantage of being split up into a number of sections and
classes, and there was the danger from the outset of their
being disunited by internal jealousies. It is the man that
makes the movement as much as the movement makes the
man. There were a number of ready champions of the
general cause, but when they came to take stock of the claims
of each it was found there was only one man who could be
followed with confidence. This was a young fellow named
Dredge, known familiarly to most of the London letter-carriers
as Tom Dredge. He was a good speaker, with a hearty, bluff
manner, and he gave the idea of a fighter who could carry his
point and would not flinch. Dredge set about organising the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
letter-carriers at his own office at the North-Western District
Office, and gradually extended the sphere of his operations
to the other districts. In this he was ably assisted by two or
three fellow-postmen acting as delegates from their various
centres. The first meeting of any importance, and the one
which mainly decided their future action, was held at Tolmer’s
Square Institute, Drummond Street, N.W., on July 23, 1887.
Dredge was the central figure and the principal speaker; and
from that night the agitation extended to the whole of the
London district postmen, and embraced a considerable number
of the suburban men. The first item on the programme of
the new agitation, of course, was the preparation of a petition
setting forth their claims. These were to include limitation
of working day to eight hours, necessity of increased pay,
extra duty to be paid for according to wages; the granting of
boots for all postmen, and lighter clothing for summer wear;
equality for all postmen in London; the resumption of the
title of “letter-carrier” in lieu of “postman”; earlier maximum
pay; a minimum of 18s. a week for all second-class postmen;
the abolition of the collection and delivery of parcels by
London postmen; and several other good things, including a
better pension scheme.</p>

<p>The petition was presented, but nothing satisfactory came
of it. There were more meetings, growing in indignation,
and Tom Dredge became a power everywhere among the
letter-carriers or, as they were now called, postmen. They
secured the support of Mr. H. L. W. Lawson, M.P., and he
presided over a meeting at Tolmer’s Square Institute, more
than a thousand men of all grades being present. Besides
this public countenance to the efforts of the letter-carriers, his
influence on their behalf was exerted in the House of Commons
on several occasions. One result of Mr. Lawson’s efforts in
this direction was obtaining a departmental committee to
examine the question of uniform, concerning which so many
complaints were made. In many ways did the member for
St. Pancras assist the letter-carriers in furtherance of their
aims. The public holiday agitation, which dislocated the
telegraph staff at the time, drew forth the interest of Mr.
Lawson, and many were the communications between him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
and the Postmaster-General. But the holiday was not granted,
nor was extra pay allowed.</p>

<p>Through him the letter-carriers presented a petition to Mr.
Raikes, praying for a consideration of their case; and the
Postmaster-General intimated that he would do all he possibly
could, consistently with the interests of the public, to meet the
wishes of the men. But just when it was thought that their
sails had caught the fair breeze of public approval, and it was
felt their barque was nearing a safe harbour, their vessel suddenly
grounded on a rock. Tom Dredge, the secretary of
the organisation of district and suburban letter-carriers, was
pounced on for a dereliction of official duty, and punished
with reduction in the ranks. The circumstances of the case
seem to have been rather harsh, but being away on sick-leave
at the time, it was not till his return to duty that he felt the
full force of the official rebuff. The local postmaster informed
Dredge that the Secretary had advised Dredge’s reduction,
because he had taken a prominent part in the postmen’s
agitation for increase of pay, &amp;c. The Postmaster-General
endorsed the recommendation that he be reduced to the
second class of postmen, and instructed that he be warned
that if he continued in the same way he would be dismissed.
The specific charge brought against Dredge was that of writing
to the press on official matters, and for purposes of promoting
an agitation, in contravention of rule.</p>

<p>Mr. Raikes was charged with inconsistency and unnecessarily
interfering with the right of combination among the
postal servants; but the Postmaster-General defended his
action, and maintained that he had dealt leniently in the
circumstances. The reduction had been accompanied with
a caution to abstain from such questionable methods of agitation
for the future; but a few months later the secretary of
the postmen’s organisation tempted fate still further, and the
end came. A printed notice had been issued and signed by
Dredge calling a mass meeting at the Memorial Hall, without
the proper sanction of the Postmaster-General having been
obtained, and in contravention of Rule 42 of the regulations.
This meeting the Postmaster-General prohibited, but a few
days afterwards, Dredge called a general meeting for the purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
of discussing matters of departmental control, including
the action of the Postmaster-General. For this he was called
on to explain as to why, after being emphatically cautioned,
he had persistently endeavoured to stir up agitation. His
explanation notwithstanding, Dredge was dismissed.</p>

<p>The Postmaster-General’s treatment of this particular case,
and his attitude towards the postmen’s agitation at this period,
may seem strangely in contrast with the indulgence shown
towards the letter-sorters. But it has to be remembered that
with the latter body there was never any attempt to force the
right of public meeting before the rule was relaxed; and
besides, they experienced little indulgence at Mr. Raikes’s
hands till some time after the period of Dredge’s dismissal.
It was not till a year after that Mr. Raikes began to mellow
in his demeanour towards the sorters’ agitation.</p>

<p>His mellowing and unbending somewhat towards the growing
spirit of trades unionism in the Post-Office may perhaps
be ascribed to expediency as much as to conviction of its
justifiableness. For about this period of 1890 a tidal wave of
discontent, it seemed, affected almost every class of public
and Government servants, and threatened to sweep them off
their feet. The spirit of restlessness and discontent not only
affected the police, the telegraphists, the sorters, and the
postmen, but it even made itself felt to some extent in the army.
Mr. Raikes had to realise that he was facing a very delicate
and difficult problem, and though he did not take kindly to
his lesson at first, he squared his shoulders and faced it manfully
and tactfully when he saw the cloud about to burst. It
was his duty to play his own game from the departmental
side of the board, and his move consisted in keeping the discontented
bodies apart at any hazards, and this by his tact
and good judgment he succeeded in doing. He was sorry
that he was compelled to dismiss Dredge, and perhaps foresaw
the consequences. There was immediately a strong feeling
manifested among the postmen; for Dredge was popular; and
though the blow caused them to retire for a moment to get
their wind, they came up in stronger fighting trim than ever.
It was this dismissal really that led up to the formation of
the ill-starred but, for a time, formidable Postmen’s Union.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
Dredge’s dismissal was interpreted into a direct attack on the
postmen’s right of combination, and the Chief Office men, who
hitherto had been rather lukewarm towards the agitation led
by him, now as a matter of principle formed square with the
Districts. It was decided to form a General Postmen’s Union,
but it was ill managed on misunderstanding from the start.</p>

<p>In the early part of 1890 the discontent born of a long period
of neglect and refusal to consider their moderate demands
reached an acute and critical stage. The necessity for some
sort of an organisation of postmen was beginning to be recognised
among them, and it was then decided to start the Postmen’s
Union. A request privately made by the postmen
themselves to several prominent labour leaders was the means
of bringing it into existence. The Postmen’s Union, doomed
to run an exciting career ending in disaster and failure, was
hatched under the wing of the well-meaning but in this case
misguided Labour Union leadership. Mr. John Burns, with
the laurels of the dock strike fresh upon him, had some little
time previously offered his services to form and conduct a Postmen’s
Union; and had his offer been accepted at the time, it
is more than probable that his good sense and tact would have
averted one of the most lamentable catastrophes that ever
sullied the pages of labour’s history. If it was necessary to
form the Postmen’s Union at all, it was as necessary to place
the leadership in strong, sensible hands. It was not so, however;
and the opportunity of accepting Mr. John Burns as
leader was lost. And it was lost only because it was feared
that Mr. John Burns would want to exercise a too autocratic
sway. Better, perhaps, had it been so; for, as will be seen,
they rushed from one extreme to the other. They threw over
a born and trained labour leader and accepted the dictates of a
weak imitator.</p>

<p>The representations made to the Labour Union were to the
effect that postmen as a body and all postal employés were in
a helpless and disorganised condition; that they dared not take
the initiative for fear of instant dismissal. These representations
were accepted, and a meeting was speedily called on a
Sunday, the meeting-place being Clerkenwell Green. This
meeting was called by means of a manifesto published in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
Saturday’s <cite>Star</cite>. There the Postmen’s Union was publicly inaugurated,
its principal sponsors being Messrs. Mahon, Chambers,
and Henderson. All postal employés were invited to
join the organisation. The executive, consisting of Mr. Mahon
and the other gentlemen mentioned, announced that their
only desire was to establish the new postal association on a
proper basis, and that when this consummation was effected
they would be willing to leave the postmen to manage their
own affairs.</p>

<p>The restrictions as regarded public meetings had already
been considerably relaxed by Mr. Raikes, and from being
strictly prohibited were now allowed under certain conditions.
The conditions imposed by Mr. Raikes were:—</p>

<p>“That notice be given to the local Post-Office authority that
such a meeting was to be held, and where it was proposed to
hold it. That the meeting be confined to Post-Office servants
only who are directly interested in the matters to be discussed.
That an official shorthand writer be present if required by the
authorities.”</p>

<p>It was under the operation of this new rule that the letter-sorters’
organisation was publicly inaugurated at the Memorial
Hall on February 10, 1890. But the leader of the Postmen’s
Union detected in the second condition imposed by the regulation
a direct blow at the right of combination, and an attempt
to deprive the postmen of their accepted leadership. It was to
test as much as to form the Postmen’s Union that this meeting
was called on Clerkenwell Green in June 1890. Mr. Mahon
had been one of the sub-organisers of the late dock strike,
and on assuming authority over the Postmen’s Union he endeavoured
to make himself the accepted mouthpiece of the
men’s demands. But whatever qualities of leadership Mr.
Mahon may have possessed, he lacked individuality. His
personality was certainly not Napoleonic; he could deliver a
good address, but there was always a something lacking in the
uncommanding figure in the shabby blue serge suit. He was
a thin-featured, pale-faced man, with a slight red beard, and
pale blue eyes. The postmen, however, wanted an outside
leader, and if Mahon was to prove their Messiah of postal
labour they were to make the most of him and obediently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
follow. Nevertheless the members seemed possessed by a fear
that they were doing something wrong and might only conduct
their affairs in secret; precautions being taken to prevent the
identity of members being freely known. Both officers and
members were known only by numbers; and adhesive stamps
were used to indicate the subscriptions paid; these stamps
being supplied to members to affix them to their cards when
they felt free from espionage. There was but one exception to
this extraordinary secrecy; and that was in the case of Clery,
the secretary of the Fawcett Association, who had become a
member from sympathy with their objects. He stoutly declined
to be known by a number, and advised the Postmen’s Union
that they were perfectly within their right in combining openly
and without this element of secrecy. He went further, and
wrote a pamphlet on the subject of postal combination, which
was published by Mr. J. McCartney, a member of the Fawcett
Association, and issued from the offices of the Postmen’s
Union.</p>

<p>The postmen seemed so determined on following the dictates
of the Labour Union, and so enamoured of an outside leader,
that for the time Dredge, their quondam secretary, seemed
forgotten. The manifesto which had heralded the birth of the
Postmen’s Union invited them practically to come and have
their grievances redressed by men not in the service, who
could not be dismissed for speaking up for them. But the
dismissed Dredge could have done all this as fearlessly and as
ably as any of the Union leaders had he been invited to—and
better for the postmen and better for him had the leadership
been at this stage placed in his hands.</p>

<p>The Postmen’s Union had not been called into existence
very long before there was a split in the executive, and the
postmen were treated to the demoralising spectacle of a double-headed
leadership—a Girondist and a Mountain party in
miniature. There was a manifesto printed in the <cite>Evening
News and Post</cite>, and signed by Messrs. T. Dredge, Fred
Henderson, and W. Chambers, in which they announced that
they had dissociated themselves from the rest of the executive.
W. E. Clery of the Fawcett Association endeavoured to bring
about a <i lang="fr">rapprochement</i> between the parties, and Mr. Morrison<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
Davidson, the author, was asked to act as arbitrator, to which
he agreed. The proposal, however, was not carried out, those
remaining on the executive not agreeing to the suggestion.
Messrs. Henderson, Chambers, and Dredge were regarded as
having seceded from the movement by the publication of the
manifesto; but this did not put the matter straight, as, to a
very large section of the postmen, Dredge, Henderson, and
Chambers were still the leaders of the movement. The books
and the funds of the Union were, however, still in the hands
of Messrs. Mahon, Donald, and the others, meanwhile maintaining
silence about the split in the camp, and quietly but
industriously receiving subscriptions and enrolling members.
Messrs. Chambers and Henderson set about organising a meeting
in Marylebone, to which postmen were invited to hear a
true explanation of the situation and the nature of the difference
between them and their late colleagues. The meeting was
held under the presidency of Mr. Champion, and Mr. John
Burns and Mr. Conybeare, M.P., were present. The latter
gentleman was at this time treasurer of the Union. Mr. John
Burns did not mince matters with anybody, but treated all
alike to a helping of strong straight talk and wholesome advice
which, if only remembered and followed, would have saved
them many bitter regrets. It was on this occasion, after the
business of the meeting, that Mr. John Burns definitely allowed
it to be known that he would accept a position on their executive,
but that they would have to approach him. There was
some consideration on the part of some, a further excited
meeting, at which Mr. Mahon was present; but it was found
neither party could claim the full confidence of the postmen,
and so it was decided to submit the matter of the disputed
leadership to a commission of inquiry having power to demand
all books and correspondence, &amp;c., and to report on the condition
of the Union, and the trustworthiness of the executive in
power. A general meeting was to be called to hear this report
as soon as ready. The commission of inquiry consisted of
three, and Clery, of the letter-sorters’ agitation, was elected
chairman. There was a deal of recrimination between the
parties before the decision of the commission was made known.
It was recommended that the Postmen’s Union executive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
should sever its connection with the Labour Union, but that
the executive should consist of nine gentlemen not in the
service, and an equal number of postmen. The gentlemen
who were to serve on the executive were to include Mr.
Mahon as secretary; Mr. Conybeare, M.P., as treasurer; Mr.
A. K. Donald; Mr. Bennet Burleigh, the war correspondent
and journalist; Mr. John Burns, and Mr. H. H. Champion.
But Mr. Mahon and Mr. Donald objected to Mr. Burns and
Mr. Champion being on the executive. W. E. Clery and his
fellow-commissioners were in favour of these two gentlemen,
and only agreed not to press their election out of consideration
to the wishes of Messrs. Mahon, Donald, and Binning, who
had certainly done a deal of rough work in connection with
the Union’s formation. Clery and the rest of the commission
had reason afterwards to regret that they had not persisted in
their first decision.</p>

<p>The Postmen’s Union was accordingly taken out of the
hands of the Labour Union, and its control was taken over by
a distinct executive. Mr. Burns and Mr. Champion withdrew
their offer of services, and allowed Mr. Mahon to take the
helm of the clumsy and ill-fitted vessel that required much
clever steering. Those who originally came into the movement
only as friendly helpers were now developed into leaders
and masters of the new organisation. Mr. Mahon now assumed
the part of dictator, and the fact that he was allowed to do so
can only be accounted for on the supposition that the other
members of the executive, Mr. Bennet Burleigh and Mr. Conybeare
and the rest, were paying more attention to their own
private business. W. E. Clery meanwhile had used the whole
weight of his influence to induce the postmen’s executive, as
represented by Mr. Mahon, to switch the organisation on to
more constitutional lines of action, but the very attempt at
counselling moderation seemed only to have begotten suspicion
regarding the honesty of his intentions. Mr. Mahon and a
few about him were under the impression that the letter-sorters
and the indoor staffs were in duty bound to make common
cause with them, and if only their co-operation could be secured
the walls of St. Martin’s-le-Grand were bound to fall. Had the
indoor staffs of the postal side of the service been induced to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
join hands, there can be no doubt that such a federation would
have proved very troublesome to the authorities. But Clery,
who was by this time virtual leader of the sorters’ organisation,
seeing that the postmen under their outside leader were determined
on pursuing a heroic course and adopting a policy of
defiance, steadily set his face against any combination of his
class with the Postmen’s Union. Mr. Mahon and many of
the postmen themselves thought it would greatly assist them if
the indoor classes could be induced to join them, and it was
sought to set aside the authority of Clery with his own class
by making overtures direct to the sorters. This was done by
a printed manifesto, but Clery thought so little of its effect
that he contemptuously printed it with a few lines of comment
in his own organ, the <cite>Post</cite>, of June 7, 1890. Yet in spite of
this free advertisement there was no response to the appeal of
the general secretary of the Postmen’s Union, and, so far as
was known, not a single sorter joined. The manifesto was a
creditable literary production, for Mr. Mahon could write as
well as speak, but the only thing he could boast of having
done in a period of eight months was to have formed “a
rapidly-growing union with a weekly contribution.” From this
declaration it was further gathered that the principal reason
for its existing at all was to assert “the right of public meeting
and demonstration,” in defiance of an official regulation now
so modified as to be no longer regarded as harsh. This was
the main point of difference between the postmen’s policy and
that of the sorters. The sorters had won the right of public
meeting fairly, squarely, and constitutionally, and Mr. Raikes
was pleased to acknowledge it; the postmen, as led by their
outside leader, asserted the full right of public meeting without
restriction and without control from headquarters. It was a
very proper thing perhaps, but in the circumstances it was
hardly the time of day to demand it. The sorters, by quietly
pursuing constitutional methods, were very little behind the
postmen in point of outside meeting, only in the one case it
was acknowledged as a right and in the other they committed
outlawry, and by so doing injured their own case. The Postmaster-General
was severely autocratic in rule, yet, when properly
approached, he had gone considerably out of the beaten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
tracks of officialdom in granting the right of public meeting
conditionally. Only a little while longer and the last shackle
was to be knocked off. Yet this did not suit the postmen’s
leader, and his followers were made to think that it could not
be accepted by them. They were betrayed into pursuing the
ideal of an abstract principle in preference to urging their more
useful and legitimate demand for boots and better wages. The
boots and other things to which they were as justly entitled
were forgotten in the glamour of the right of public demonstration.
Instead of making do with the farthing rushlight for
the time being, they committed the fatal mistake of running
after the will-o’-the-wisp which was to land them in the morass
of humiliation and disaster.</p>

<p>Finding the leaders of the Postmen’s Union could not be
persuaded to return to the slower but surer methods of constitutional
propaganda, Clery left that body with the intention
of devoting himself exclusively to the work of his own organisation.</p>

<p>By the assertion of the right of public meeting and demonstration
it was thought to force the Postmaster-General to his
knees. But it was not to be. If it was thought that what had
been done by Booth in the case of the famous Cannon Street
Hotel and Exeter Hall meetings might again be done by means
of an outside professional agitator, they were mistaken. True,
the earlier public demonstrations were in defiance of official
rules and prohibitions; but these were demonstrations of a
united postal service, of a movement to which scores of the
public men of the day had given their countenance; and Booth
and his followers adopted such a means as the only alternative
to holding cooped-up meetings on the official premises. That
was in 1873, and this was in 1890. Circumstances and conditions
had considerably altered since that period, and the
right of free public meeting was already for all workable
purposes an accomplished fact.</p>

<p>Instead of continuing as it started, with the purpose of
securing those material benefits to which postmen were entitled,
the Postmen’s Union very imprudently demanded that their
grievances should be laid before the Postmaster-General by
Mr. Mahon, their secretary, personally. As they ought to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
have anticipated, this request was refused or ignored; and it
was then that they determined to publicly assert their right
to open-air demonstration. Their meeting-place was again
Clerkenwell Green. From there they fired their shell into
St Martin’s-le-Grand. The response was prompt, and a
number of men who had made themselves conspicuous, or
whose names were secretly reported, were suspended, and had
to be maintained by the funds. The postmen’s leader sought
to open negotiations with St. Martin’s-le-Grand, and wrote to
the Postmaster-General that the men who had attended the
prohibited meeting would apologise on conditions. The conditions
that Mr. Mahon wished to impose were that all
restriction on the right of public meeting should be withdrawn;
that the suspended men should be reinstated after
tendering their apology; that the Postmaster-General should
immediately obtain the sanction of the Treasury to increase
the pay of both established and unestablished postmen, and
that the permanently-employed auxiliary staff should be placed
on the establishment. Mr. Raikes replied, but refused to
recognise Mr. Mahon as the postmen’s representative.</p>

<p>It was decided to further assert the right of public meeting,
and a monster Hyde Park demonstration was organised for
Sunday, June 19. The postmen in mufti turned up in considerable
numbers with their friends; Mr. Mahon and some
others made some strong utterances. An official note-taker,
attending by official instruction, was recognised and rather
roughly handled. In consequence of this meeting, and the
disturbance that ensued, another thirteen men were next day
suspended from duty.</p>

<p>But the agitation still continued to progress, the men being
supported in their academic demand for a free public platform
by a section of the public press and a few public men. The
leader of the Postmen’s Union now thought that he was in a
position to dictate terms to the Postmaster-General, and repeated
the demands of the men in an ultimatum despatched
one afternoon by special messenger. The inclusion of the
request that the Postmen’s Union and its secretary should be
officially recognised, induced Mr. Raikes to ignore it entirely.
No reply being forthcoming the same day, a meeting was held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
in the evening at the Holborn Town Hall, Mr. Conybeare and
Mr. Cunningham-Graham giving their support. Nothing,
however, was decided on, as meanwhile a rumour had been
disseminated that the suspended men were to be reinstated
without loss of pay. The next day, July 8, was thought by
the authorities to be a critical one, as it was rumoured that the
men had separated from the Town Hall meeting with the
understanding that if additional hands appeared for duty at
any of the offices in the morning, the Union men were not only
themselves to turn out, but to turn out the new men also.
This information had been hastily conveyed to the authorities
by a confidential reporter the same night. Preparations for
an emergency were made accordingly, but the day proved
uneventful beyond a few protests against the introduction
of strangers at some of the outlying offices. The City men,
however, exhibited a somewhat stronger feeling against the
emergency men. There were excited gatherings in the
kitchens, and on one or two occasions the officials found it
difficult to persuade the men to return to the sorting-offices.
No reply being forthcoming from the Postmaster-General to
decide the point immediately in dispute, a few of the men
demanded that he should be sent for. On one of these occasions
three or four of the sorters, carried away by the excitement
of the moment, very mistakenly, it was alleged, promised
the postmen the support of their class. This reaching the ears
of the officials, they were immediately suspended from duty;
and of those suspended four ultimately were dismissed. Two
of the sorters so dismissed, who had made themselves prominent
in agitation, Stevens and Baylis, on leaving the
service prospered fairly well; Stevens emigrated and became
a Canadian farmer, and Baylis a local celebrity and
a hard-working parish reformer in the south-east quarter of
London.</p>

<p>The Controller, to avoid a more serious disturbance, withdrew
the emergency men for the time. The postal authorities,
nevertheless, felt that they were trembling on the brink
of war, and while strong bodies of men drawn from all classes
outside were posted out of sight wherever they might be required
in the event of a sudden open rupture, almost equally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
large bodies of police were in readiness to afford them protection
if need be.</p>

<p>The first engagement of the ill-advised and ill-planned
campaign was begun at Mount Pleasant Parcel Depot on the
morning of July 9. There the Union men made an onslaught
on the new-comers, and after a short sharp struggle turned
them out of the place. It was but a momentary victory, however,
for which they were to pay dearly by the suspension and
dismissal of a large number during the next few hours. The
news of the outburst at Mount Pleasant heightened the excitement
among the men at the Chief Office, and the discovery
that a number of relief men had been drafted in intensified
the feeling. A telegram was sent by the postmen to Mr.
Raikes, stating their intention to suspend work until the interlopers
were dismissed. They were, however, persuaded to
proceed with their duties pending a reply. No reply being
forthcoming, the demand for the dismissal of the objectionable
relief men and the withdrawal of the police was repeated
by means of several deputations to the Controller, but the
demand was not acceded to.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, as it was generally understood that the executive
of the Postmen’s Union contemplated the madness of a
strike, Clery and the Fawcett Association did all that was
possible to bring their fellow-servants to a better understanding.
Clery had called together about 150 of the postmen,
and suggested that the Postmen’s Union should definitely
abandon the strike policy which they had tacitly adopted in
favour of some means of arbitration afterwards to be settled
on, and a formal proposition embodying this suggestion was
duly seconded, recommending that the executive should consider
it. Clery’s motive in putting forward this idea was twofold:
one, and the principal one, being an earnest desire to
save the postmen from pursuing such a suicidal course as they
contemplated; and the other to disabuse their minds that
the letter-sorters intended to join with them. It had been
circulated among them that Clery’s followers were falling away;
that both Clery and Williams had failed to prevent the sorters
from joining with them in large numbers. To more effectually
dispose of such misstatements, a meeting of the sorters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
was on July 9th hurriedly called in the Foreign Branch, General
Post-Office, and over a thousand men being present, a resolution
was passed expressing sympathy with the just demands
of the postmen, but entirely repudiating and deprecating their
strike policy. A deputation of postmen were invited to be
present, and they left to attend a meeting of the Postmen’s
Union held at ten o’clock at Clerkenwell Green the same
evening. Yet the same misstatement was persisted in, and
the newspapers the next morning announced that Mr. Mahon
informed his audience that, at a meeting of the sorting force
held in the General Post-Office that evening, a resolution
pledging those present to join with the postmen was unanimously
carried.</p>

<p>At this Clerkenwell Green meeting, which had been called
in order to decide their next step, a huge but mixed crowd of
postmen and onlookers assembled to listen to the fiery denunciation
of the Postmaster-General by Mr. Mahon. The
gauntlet was at last thrown down, and it was decided that
they were to refuse to go out on delivery the following
morning until they learnt that the “blacklegs” had been dispensed
with.</p>

<p>Needless to say, the authorities were kept well informed of
every utterance and every movement of Mr. Mahon, and
almost as quickly as if he had himself telephoned his uttered
intention to St. Martin’s-le-Grand, the Postmaster-General
and his advisers knew the decision come to by the men by
the dictation of their leader. Accordingly the higher officials
spent the whole night and early morning in deciding on their
plan of action. At three o’clock in the morning, the Permanent
Secretary and some other officials presented themselves
at the Mount Pleasant Parcel Depot, and as the men
hurried in to sign the attendance books, called them up, and
dismissed nearly a hundred of those who had made themselves
prominent in the previous day’s disturbance. By this sharp
and decisive measure it was hoped that the postmen of the
Chief Office would be deterred from taking the step they had
the previous evening decided on, for it was felt that the attitude
of the London postmen generally would be largely
decided by those at St. Martin’s-le-Grand. Arrangements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
for meeting the emergency were made accordingly. The impressive
moment arrived for their appearing on duty in the
early hours of the 10th only a short time after the <i lang="fr">coup</i> at
Mount Pleasant. The majority of the men on their way to
work had learnt by various means, from night policemen
and from some of the dismissed men themselves, what had
occurred. Those who had not already learnt of the summary
dismissals at Mount Pleasant an hour or so before were now
informed by an official notice confronting them at the entrance.
This notice informed them that similar suspension or dismissal
would follow in the case of men at other offices who,
either by refusal to obey orders or the molestation of those
employed under direction of the Postmaster-General, impeded
the public service. The men who, it seems, had been expected
by Mr. Mahon to act automatically in accordance with
the decision arrived at, having no one near them to inspire
them, or to strengthen them in their wavering, and confronted
on the one hand by the official proclamation, and on the other
by a strong detachment of City police, one by one, silently and
sheepishly, went in and took up their various duties. Besides
the strong detachment of City police prepared to deal with
them summarily at the first sign of disorder, there were the
relief men ready to take their places. They themselves felt
like a regiment of irregulars without a leader, and there was
no General Mahon present to give them the word of command.
And perhaps it was as well for the general himself
and all concerned. The head officials, who were unseen
watching from a distance the entrance of the half-hearted and
demoralised men, drew a sigh of relief, for they felt the real
and graver danger was over.</p>

<p>The news rapidly spread that the City men had gone in to
work; and the effect was spontaneous almost everywhere
throughout the districts, except at the Eastern District Office.
The Northern men and the South-Eastern men, who had taken
up a very firm attitude, almost immediately went in. But at
one or two other places, Finsbury Park, and Holloway, the
men refused to go out on delivery, and were promptly suspended.
The only important contingent who took the extreme
step in a body were the Eastern District men. These, reinforced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
by driblets from other sources, made up a body of
about three hundred, who by a woeful misunderstanding and
want of information had refused to take up their duties. They
marched in order to the General Post-Office, expecting there
to find the various other districts assembled in triumphant
defiance. These misguided men marched in a solid body
towards the City, and instead of being greeted as they expected
by the welcoming shouts of the whole of the district and City
postmen in possession of St. Martin’s-le-Grand, found the grim
grey General Post-Office standing amidst solitude and silence.
Except for the police on duty, and the few wondering pedestrians,
the streets were deserted at that early hour; and then,
after standing still and wondering for a few seconds, they
understood. It was now close on six o’clock in the morning;
they could hear the steady clank, clank of the stamping
machines within the great crowded hive, and to these men who
had risked all for an ideal, it seemed like intended mockery at
their foolishness. They began to realise that they had grasped
at the shadow, and lost the substance. Impelled by mingled
feelings of hope, despair, and rage, they, as with one accord,
wheeled into regimental order, and circled in a moving body
round the General Post-Office. Round and round they circled,
again and again breaking forth into soulless and dispirited cheers
to attract those safe within. Nothing more pathetic can be
imagined than those cheers, which were but as a voice crying
in the wilderness, and flung back to them in echo from the
granite walls towering above them. With the police at their
heels, and ruin confronting them, they despairingly kept on
the move for one weary hour or more, threading the narrow
thoroughfares which irregularly surround the General Post-Office;
and the cheers, at first of simulated defiance, now
died away in almost a piteous groan. Then at last the City
police, taking stern action, prevented them from demonstrating
any further; and the wretched heart-broken remnant of the
strike army gradually melted away towards the East, whence,
in the sunrise, they had emerged so hopeful and so triumphant
in anticipation.</p>

<p>During the day the number of men who paid the inevitable
penalty of their folly reached nearly three hundred. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
evening there was an attempt at a muster after the battle, and
several hundred men again assembled on Clerkenwell Green.
Mr. Mahon addressed them, and endeavoured to reanimate
them by announcing that the real Waterloo was to be fought
on the morrow, when the whole of the London postmen would
be called out on strike. Every postman within the Metropolitan
area was exhorted to obey the summons.</p>

<p>The morrow came, however; and instead of the general
rising and the consequent paralysing of the commerce of the
country as was predicted, the postmen, realising the extremity
to which they had been pushed and the failure of it, unconditionally
surrendered, by going about their duties as usual.
The whole movement had collapsed, and the Postmen’s Union
was broken up. During the next two days the authorities
were inundated with applications from the suspended and
dismissed men for reinstatement, and therewith offering abject
apology.</p>

<p>In all 435 men were either peremptorily dismissed or suspended
with almost the certainty of dismissal. Of these
263 belonged to the unestablished, and 172 to the established
class. Mr. Raikes triumphed; but it brought him almost as
much worry and bitterness of spirit as a defeat would have
done.</p>

<p>The postmen’s strike had ended in even more ignominious
failure than had the telegraphists’ strike of twenty years previous.
Once more the lesson had been proved that it was
suicide for any single section of State servants to attempt
to fight with the weapon of a strike a Government with
inexhaustible resources, and without the assistance of an
enlightened public sympathy on their side.</p>

<p>CONTINUANCE OF TELEGRAPHISTS’ AGITATION—NATURE OF
GRIEVANCES—“TELEGRAPHISTS’ CRAMP”—AN OUTCOME
OF THE SUNDAY QUESTION—THE CARDIFF EXILES—CONDEMNATION
OF POSTMASTER-GENERAL—THE “NO
OVERTIME” PROTEST.</p>

</div>

<p>For several years after the introduction of the Fawcett
scheme in 1881, the telegraph service had remained in a
state of sullen discontent. The formation of the Postal
Telegraph Clerks’ Association in the December of the same
year in which Mr. Fawcett introduced his measure, did
much to keep alive, for the next ten years, the memory of
their wrongs. The grievances of the telegraph clerks, notwithstanding
Mr. Fawcett’s intention, were still so numerous
and so genuine, that on the face of it it seemed questionable
whether it had brought them any benefit worth speaking of
at all. The same measure of relief which the sorters were
clamouring for and agitating because, as they thought, it
was being withheld from them, was, from its very inadequacy
to meet the justice of their demands, the main cause
of discontent among the telegraphists. What the sorters
thought it would be a boon to get in its entirety, the telegraphists
were now discontented with; and not only were
they discontented with the scheme itself for the reasons
already shown, but that discontent was still further promoted
by the systematic manner in which its few benefits were minimised
in their application. The majority of telegraphists
were still compelled to bolster up their meagre incomes by
means of extra duty, and they were still, after all their
agitation, face to face with the hated system of classification
and all its attendant evils, irregularity and stagnation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
promotion. Since the introduction of the Fawcett scheme
the quality and value of their work had greatly improved,
while their duties had become yearly more arduous and
responsible. Their hours of duty were longer and far
more irregular, the pay was insufficient, and daily growing
more so when the cost of living and rent was considered,
and their privileges were fewer than ever. The few prizes
offered by the Fawcett scheme, the few higher promotions
from their ranks to the supervising and superintending
staff, brought no comfort or satisfaction to the hungry and
underpaid army of the lower ranks. Even the overtime, the
one means by which they could set up a barrier between
themselves and actual want, which, indeed, they were forced to
accept to preserve their respectability, was badly paid for and
unjustly distributed. Owing to the constant fluctuation in
the amount of work, the telegraphists were frequently required
to perform overtime at a minute’s notice at almost
all hours of the day and night. Overtime became morally
and officially compulsory, and it was only by means of it that
they could earn a respectable income. In the same manner
that the postmen’s Christmas-boxes were used against them as
a means of keeping down their wages, so was compulsory
overtime, paid for at slender rates, forced on the telegraphists
in extension of their nominal eight hours’ day. The confining
of a day’s work to eight hours, even had it been allowable,
would for the vast majority have spelt privation and poverty.
So that a decent week’s earnings, representing what is now
known and accepted as a decent living wage, meant for the
telegraphist, not the working week of eight hours’ days, but a
week of twelve, fourteen, and more hours daily. The extensive
and increasing use of code and cipher messages
requiring the most delicate discrimination in transmission,
the many added responsibilities, the strain on the mental
faculties and nervous system continued and sustained during
these long working hours, caused in many cases premature
breakdown and too early superannuation. An analysis of
the superannuation report for 1885-86 showed that of the
total number of telegraph clerks pensioned during that period
no less than fifty per cent. were compelled to retire at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
comparatively early age, owing to affections of the brain and
nervous system induced by the constant strain. These facts
alone were sufficient to notify the existence of discontent
among them. But there were other grievances too numerous
to be catalogued, generally speaking, although Mr. Fawcett
had enunciated the principle of payment for work according
to its quality. The adoption of the Fawcett scheme was
made the medium for greatly adding to the responsibilities
of juniors, while imposing on the seniors supervising duties
hitherto paid for at a higher rate. They felt that the value
and quality of their work was far from accurately measured
by the department. Whether their work consisted of transmitting
ordinary messages in the ordinary manner, or the
selected duties appertaining to special events, such as race
meetings, political speeches, &amp;c., in which rapid and accurate
manipulation was essential, they were all too poorly recompensed
and too little regarded.</p>

<p>These things are mentioned to show that it was not
merely a love of agitation for itself that animated the telegraphists
at this period. To fully recount their grievances, it
would be necessary to go into a mass of technical detail that
would only confuse, and no better convince than the few
general facts recorded. Added to all this, there was much
dissatisfaction regarding the holiday question. The annual
leave was distributed throughout the year, so that many went
for years without a summer holiday, while for the loss of Bank
holidays there was no equivalent given. Then, again, the
conditions and environments of their work were not everything
to be desired. There was, too, such a thing as “telegraphists’
cramp,” analogous to writers’ cramp, which the growing pressure
of telegraph work had introduced among the operators.
True, it was not of very frequent occurrence, but it was something
to be reckoned with, and no man knew when his turn
might come. Telegraphists’ cramp, it appears, is a nerve-wringing,
brain-torturing malady, varying in degree of intensity.
In one individual it may be confined to simply the nervous
inability to signal particular letters, in itself a fatal defect in a
telegraphist. Whatever be the pathological explanation of
this very curious nervous phenomenon, it undoubtedly affects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
telegraphists more or less, and is something to be feared, more
particularly in its ultimate results. It is a malady of such a
peculiar nature that those to the eye physically able yet may
be absolute wrecks as regards their nerves and the operation
of signalling particular things.</p>

<p>Such, then, were the grievances under which the telegraphists
laboured between 1881 and 1890. During the interval of
that eight or nine years there was, of course, a plethora of
petitions and applications for interviews; there were public
meetings, a few suspensions here and there, inflammatory
speeches, annual conferences, and more or less sympathetic
notices in the press of their doings. But there was nothing
actually achieved by the agitation so far. Some splendid
individual efforts were made, however, meanwhile; and the
names of Hughes, most prominent during 1884, North,
Norman, and others, will long be remembered as men who
fearlessly led the van when it was a perilous and delicate
task to do so. The individual efforts of these men did much
to secure the co-operation of Parliamentary friends and public
men, and among those whose services were so secured may be
mentioned Sir John Puleston, Mr. Henry Broadhurst, and
Mr. Charles Bradlaugh. Mr. Charles Bradlaugh, it will be
remembered, did much to promote the earlier postal agitation
of 1872-74, and he once more came on the scene to help the
telegraphists as he had helped the letter-carriers. He later
identified himself particularly with the question of payment for
Sunday labour for telegraphists. It was left to Mr. Charles
Bradlaugh in the House to take the ballot for a direct motion,
and it is not too much to say that it was owing to the number
of promises procured by him to vote for this special motion
that it was prevented from becoming a very close one. He
procured the promises of many Conservatives as well as the
bulk of the Liberal party. The Postmaster-General, after first
previously declining to grant this Sunday concession, as the
result gave in, and the victory of this question was complete.
Altogether too much gratitude cannot be given to Mr. Bradlaugh
for the manner in which he generally worked for the
telegraphists at this time.</p>

<p>There was a deal of work, a laying-in of stores and ammunition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
for future use, a deal of speech-making, letter-writing to
M.P.’s, and a general tightening-up of the telegraphists’ forces.
But there was no immediate and actual benefit secured, and
nothing of an exciting nature worthy of being recorded as an
event till 1889-90. The telegraph staff, in common with the
rest of Government servants, had been cajoled into the belief
that the Royal Commission on Civil Establishments would
come to afford them some relief, or at least listen to their
plaint. Much of the work in which they had latterly been
engaged was occupied in the preparation of evidence for this
expected inquiry. The disappointment that ensued only gave
a stronger impetus to the agitation, and from theorising and
pursuing debating-society methods they adopted a firmer and
more aggressive attitude. As with the letter-sorters, they
found that the evidence they had prepared and the weight of
facts they had accumulated, so far from being waste material
and a deadweight, came in very useful now for powder and
shot with which to enforce their demands.</p>

<p>What was regarded as an unduly harsh interference with the
right of combination at Cardiff some little time afterwards,
tended very considerably to arouse the fighting spirit in them,
and to bring things to the climax of an open struggle. It was
only necessary at this juncture to give the telegraphists a few
martyrs to emphasise their grievances, and arouse them to
action.</p>

<p>In the August of 1889 a disgraceful state of affairs appears
to have existed at Cardiff, telegrams being frequently seriously
delayed owing to want of sufficient staff. A paragraph appeared
in a local paper, the <cite>Western Mail</cite>, complaining of the
delay. On this editorial peg, numerous articles, leaders, and
letters were hung, till the whole correspondence assumed
voluminous proportions. The Cardiff telegraphists, from this
realising a sense of their injustice, commenced agitating by
meeting and petitions. They complained of the undermanning
of the staff and consequent overworking; the insanitary condition
of the office itself; the fact that Cardiff was one of the
worst classified offices in the kingdom; that supervisors had to
perform instrument work to the neglect of their proper duties;
that they were punished for errors unavoidably due to lack of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
supervision; favouritism, non-payment of Sunday duty, and
sundry minor grievances. In consequence of representations
made by Sir John Reed, M.P., a revision took place, and most
of the cause of complaint was removed. So far, so good. But
a sequel was to come. In the following November, the Postmaster-General,
Mr. Raikes, was announced to attend a
Church Congress in the neighbourhood, and he telegraphed
to a certain colonel at Llandaff, stating his intention to arrive
at a certain time. Through the medium of the acting postmaster,
so it was alleged, this piece of news found its way into
the <cite>South Wales Daily News</cite>. The Postmaster-General on
learning this took a very severe view of the case, and in
consequence the official was compelled to retire from the
service. While the Postmaster-General was in the Principality
a number of the Cardiff staff requested him to receive an
interview on the vexed question of Sunday work at that office.
This resolve was communicated to several provincial offices,
and the result was that some thirty telegrams were received,
asking him to receive the deputation on the general question.
The Postmaster-General promised the Cardiff staff that he
would consider. Mr. Raikes, however, left the town early
next morning, and the Cardiff men were left disappointed.
Further, the various provincial offices, which had sent the
telegrams in all good faith, were soon afterwards called on to
apologise for their conduct. Appointments becoming due at
the Cardiff office, eight of the men eligible were informed by
the surveyor that they would receive the higher appointments
only on the condition that they proved that they did not write
the paragraph which had appeared in the <cite>Western Mail</cite>,
complaining of the delay of telegrams. Failing this negative
proof of their innocence, or their inability to name the person
who made public what was now held to be a secret communication,
the promotions would be withheld, and they would
be transported. As this punishment of transportation to other
distant towns where they were strangers meant the breaking-up
of their homes, and the severance of family ties and
friendly relationships, the telegraphists concerned felt they
were the victims of injustice. They were informed that the
transference would be made within eight hours; and in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
short time were compelled to make what arrangement they
could for the future, not even knowing to what distant part
of the kingdom they would be severally deported. They,
against whom nothing more than a suspicion rested of having
communicated an innocent item of news, were actually transferred,
with little time for leave-taking, next day. They were
sent away to various offices. On the night that the first two
were ordered away the staff held an impromptu meeting, and
the places of the eight men who formed the secretaries and
committee of the local branch of the association were filled up.
But these officers were also, as soon as it was known, promptly
given orders to hold themselves in readiness for transference.
It has to be noted here, that Sunday pay was at the time an
important item in the general programme, and these men at
Cardiff had prepared to urge it strongly; for it was not till
some months later that, through the instrumentality of Mr.
Bradlaugh in the House of Commons, the question was settled
in their favour.</p>

<p>The despotic treatment meted out to the Cardiff men induced
Sir E. J. Reed, M.P., to take up their case in real
earnest. For the supposed dereliction of duty they were to
be penalised by the loss of a £25 increment, besides being
packed off to unknown regions within a few hours. Besides
Sir E. J. Reed, other influential public men took the matter
up, and the case of the Cardiff “exiles” commanded some
attention in the House. But the Postmaster-General was not
to be moved by any argument, and contended that it was not
intended as punishment, and was ultimately for the men’s own
good. Yet while it had been stated that the men were transferred
for no other reason than that of communicating this
piece of information to the local paper, the First Lord of the
Treasury, in reply to Mr. Hanbury in June 1888, distinctly
stated that such communications could not be considered as
an offence against departmental regulations. So that if Mr.
Raikes’s treatment was not arbitrary, it was inconsistent. It
was doubly inconsistent, seeing that a higher postal official,
and not a telegraphist in the first instance, had been accused
and made to leave the service for this so-called offence.</p>

<p>The case of the Cardiff “martyrs,” as they were called, produced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
a very strong feeling against the Postmaster-General
amongst the telegraphists; and principally because of this they
could not be induced to share that good opinion held of him
by the sorters. And in truth it must be said that the Postmaster-General’s
conduct towards both the letter-carriers and
the telegraphists at this period contrasted somewhat strangely
with the leniency and indulgence shown towards the sorting
staff, and the facilities offered the latter for promoting a constitutional
agitation. Certainly the sorters’ agitation was conducted
with great caution and very little heat, while it has to
be allowed that, however Mr. Raikes may have been convinced
of the existence of grievances generally throughout the service,
the over-zeal of the letter-carriers, and the importunities of the
telegraphists in some quarters, may have caused him to draw
invidious distinctions.</p>

<p>All the evidence and all the circumstances of the Cardiff
case tend to show that Mr. Raikes, by some unaccountable
means, was induced to commit an unworthy blunder, which
helped to render him extremely unpopular with the telegraph
service. The ebullition of feeling, openly and widely expressed
by public meeting everywhere among the London
and provincial telegraphists, and sympathetically reported by
the press, so far convinced Mr. Raikes that he had made a
mistake, that he afterwards modified his charge against the
Cardiff men. This incident, in conjunction with other things,
helped very considerably to tighten the sinews of the organisation.
And in the meantime, while indignation at the inquisitorial
treatment of their Cardiff brethren was at its height,
the London telegraphists, who hitherto had been but loosely
hanging on to the skirts of the Postal Telegraph Clerks’
Association, closed up their ranks, and on December 17, 1889,
went over in a solid and enthusiastic body. Great was the
rejoicing when the London men definitely joined hands with
the provinces. The accession of 7500 Metropolitan men was
certainly something to be jubilant over.</p>

<p>With the fresh reinforcements everywhere, the tide of indignation
and dissatisfaction spread over the United Kingdom.
For two months nearly, each day saw some expression of the
feeling which had taken possession of the telegraph service,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
and some of the papers discerned all the preparations for an
early strike among telegraphists everywhere. It became not a
question of Cardiff particularly, but one in which the whole
telegraph service was involved and identified with. From
Land’s End to John o’ Groats there was an eruptive unrest;
and the whole press of the country—Liberal and Tory, Radical
and Independent—was kept busy in recording the utterances
and commenting on the doings of telegraphists in meeting
assembled everywhere. The Postmaster-General was inundated
with a steady flow of petitions from every quarter; and
besides being heckled from within the service and without, in
the press and on the platform, Mr. Raikes experienced a very
lively time of it in the House of Commons. There can be little
doubt that during this busy and exciting period, with newspaper
censure hurled at him from everywhere, and threats and
prognostications of direful postal strikes filling the air, the
Postmaster-General must have been far more severely punished
than the victims of his mistake, the martyrs of Cardiff. This
kind of thing lasted unceasingly till April 15, 1890, when the
whole question of telegraphists’ grievances was ventilated in
the House of Commons by Earl Compton. Earl Compton
minutely traversed the ground of their grievances, and was
ably supported; but Mr. Raikes defended his administration
to the satisfaction of the House, and the motion was in due
course lost by thirty-nine votes.</p>

<p>But although the telegraphists’ case was defeated, it was
manifest that the matter could not long rest where it was.
The feeling by this time was too strained and too acute to be
allayed by an official refusal. All the dormant energies of
the telegraphists were put forth, and grievances which had
remained quiescent and unexpressed for years now loudly
demanded redress and readjustment.</p>

<p>Immediately after the defeat of Earl Compton’s motion in
the House, Mr. Raikes promulgated a new order restricting
the right of public meeting outside the Post-Office. The
acute stage at which the telegraphists’ agitation had now
arrived was contemporaneous with the trouble among the
postmen. The growing aggressiveness of the two postal
bodies, the telegraphists and the postmen, and the free use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
they were making of public meeting, induced the Postmaster-General
to restrict their freedom in this respect by reviving
Lord Stanley’s order of 1866. What, however, was a restriction
in the case of the telegraphists was a distinct concession
to the postal branches of the service, and the sorters especially,
who had hitherto been compelled to meet inside Post-Office
buildings, greatly appreciated the wider liberty. What
in the circumstances was regarded by the sorters as a boon
and a concession was, after the wider liberty enjoyed by the
telegraphists, regarded by them as a direct attempt on personal
rights, and the introduction of terrorism and espionage. And
after the assertion of the right of outside public meeting by
the postmen, this view was fully shared by them. Indeed, it
was the introduction of this restrictive rule that afforded a
further excuse for the Postmen’s Union resorting to extreme
methods. In so regarding it, the postmen and the telegraphists
were at the time greatly upheld by the press, and
the Postmaster-General was subjected to a deal of sharp
criticism for his action.</p>

<p>The question of free public meeting for all postal employés,
and other matters arising out of the new Post-Office order,
so strenuously objected to by the telegraphists, were brought
under the notice of the House of Commons on April 24,
1890, Mr. Pickersgill, himself an old postal servant, and other
members, strongly urging on the Postmaster-General the desirability
of modifying the regulation. Mr. Raikes, however,
was firm in his attitude, and maintained that the new order
was really to relax the stringency of a rule which for nearly a
quarter of a century was absolutely prohibitory in its effect.</p>

<p>The day following this discussion in the House, April 25,
a deputation of telegraphists waited on the Postmaster-General
to urge that he would not only modify the rule as to public
meeting, but also that he would give immediate attention to
the many grievances of which they complained, and on which
they were agitating. Mr. Raikes promised he would refer the
whole question of their grievances to the Departmental Committee
then sitting for the purpose of assisting him to come
to a decision. The telegraphists had therefore to accept his
word for it that their case should receive attention in good time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>But meetings still continued to be held in different parts in
spite of the presence of the official reporter. His presence
was objected to at Leicester in a characteristic manner by the
suppression of the names of the speakers, so that Mr. Raikes
might know all that was said of him, but not the identity
of the speakers. The new regulation became so notorious
throughout the country that, in one instance at least, the police
authorities in Bucks actually became imbued with the idea that
these gatherings were of the nature of proclaimed meetings,
as in Ireland under the Coercion Act, and thought it part
of their duty to keep a watchful eye on all such meetings
of telegraphists. Such was a case specially referred to in
the House of Commons by Mr. Bradlaugh in a question put
May 20.</p>

<p>The question of compulsory overtime was soon afterwards
forced to the front by an admission made by Mr. Raikes in
the House, June 12, in answer to Earl Compton, that officers
of the telegraph department were not compelled against their
will, but were asked to volunteer for overtime. For some
time after that the telegraph clerks in London and Dublin
decided to take their stand on that admission, but the evil
still continued with irritating regularity. Numerous were the
published contradictions to the Postmaster—General’s statement
in the House, and the press with striking unanimity,
excepting the <cite>Times</cite>, which consistently stood by Mr. Raikes
throughout, strongly denounced the system of enforced overtime
and Mr. Raikes’s incorrect denial of its existence. After
the authoritative declaration from the official head the “no
overtime” movement was taken up enthusiastically among the
men, and spread rapidly, not only in London, but throughout
the leading provincial offices. At the Central Office in
London about 90 per cent. of the male staff pledged themselves
to decline to work overtime, and it was decided to put
this pledge into force on a certain date unless the Postmaster-General
meanwhile announced some measure of relief for
their various grievances. It was alleged that the total number
of overtime hours worked in the Central Telegraph Office alone
reached the enormous weekly total of from ten to twelve thousand,
or 30 per cent. on the day’s ordinary work, so that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
sudden withdrawal of this amount of work would have meant
a serious public inconvenience.</p>

<p>In connection with this attitude a somewhat curious and
sensational method of protest was used by the telegraphists on
the occasion of the Post-Office Jubilee. Arrangements were
made by the authorities that, at a signal sent by the Duchess of
Edinburgh from the Jubilee conversazione at South Kensington,
the whole of the postal and telegraph service on duty at the
moment should burst forth into simultaneous cheering for the
Queen. The intended pleasing tribute of loyalty was, however,
spoilt in a manner that made Mr. Raikes exceedingly indignant
with the telegraphists especially. At ten o’clock, the precise
moment having arrived, some four hundred telegraphists being
assembled in the central galleries at the Chief Office, the
superintendent called for three cheers for the Queen. But
silence was steadfastly maintained for some moments, and
then with one accord, instead of the cheers expectantly waited
for by royal ears at the other end of the telephones, the
clerks, to show their resentment, burst out into a deep groan.
Three cheers for Mr. Raikes were then asked for, but this was
met with a volume of groans deeper than before. The telegraphists,
who were afterwards officially interrogated as to the
meaning of the demonstration, strongly repudiated any intention
of disloyalty or disrespect towards her Majesty the Queen,
and explained that the demonstration was spontaneously made
as a protest against the manner in which their repeated petitions
for redress of grievances had been treated by the higher
officials surrounding Mr. Raikes. Their explanation was not
deemed satisfactory; there was much writing and further questioning
over the incident. A number of representatives were
asked to wholly dissociate themselves from what took place,
and were called on to sign a paper to that effect. The matter
was discussed, and the official memorandum was rejected by
eight to three. The names of the eight clerks who voted
against the suggestion were asked for, but they unanimously
declined to give the required information. The official memorandum
of dissociation was circulated and a number of signatures
obtained, chiefly from female telegraphists, but the large
majority of the staff declined to sign the document.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>The incident was reported in most of the papers, but while
it showed the telegraphists in no very creditable light on this
occasion, it none the less served as a big advertisement and
had the effect of turning closer attention to the nature and
extent of their grievances. The telegraphists were not applauded
for their action, but the Postmaster-General was in
some quarters mercilessly taken to task for what seemed like
giving countenance to a silly piece of snobbery on the part of
toadying officials.</p>

<p>The “no overtime” agitation continued among the telegraphists,
and so intense did the feeling become that a large
proportion were for striking against the enforcement of the
obnoxious overtime at a certain date. The feeling had gained
headway so far that a large number had actually signed a paper
set in circulation promising to obey the call to arms when the
moment arrived. But before the dramatic moment arrived
the Controller suddenly sent for a few of the more prominent
ringleaders to discuss the situation. After some parrying and
courteous preliminaries the official suddenly confronted them
with the question as to whether they would promise then and
there to use their influence with their followers to restrain them
from adopting the course decided on. There was some demur,
and the question was objected to as unfair in the circumstances.
The official gave them half-an-hour to decide and
left them, turning the key in the door as he went out. They
were virtually held prisoners in the official’s private room.
After some consideration the leaders of the agitation thought
discretion the better part of valour, and decided to give the
required promise in writing, and this was done. They were
then released and went back to their duties. One of the men,
however, was rash enough to telegraph the news to Newcastle,
with the intimation that the promise given was not seriously
intended. The message, as might have been anticipated, was
immediately “tapped” and conveyed to headquarters, with
the result that the operator was on the spot suspended from
duty. He was accordingly dismissed, and though it was not a
case in which the victim could be made either a hero or a
martyr, the telegraphists, with the generous impulse of comradeship,
rallied round him and raised a subscription, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
in a short time realised the sum of £500. The incident gave
a set-back to the “no overtime” agitation for the time, but
the feeling against the Postmaster-General was by no means
modified by its remembrance.</p>

<p>With the hostile criticism of the press and a section of the
House, and engaged in driving a pair of spirited steeds, the
telegraphists and the postmen, that threatened every moment
to break away and overturn the chariot, Mr. Raikes’s position
was no enviable one. In the circumstances too ready compliance
with the demands on either hand would probably have
been interpreted as weakness, if not by the men themselves, by
Parliament, and still more probably by the Lords of the
Treasury. Mr. Raikes was an able man, but pride generally
overrules conscience and sometimes wisdom. He was but
human; and most men in a position of power would prefer to
be accused of tyranny rather than weakness. So the tension
continued and increased till, reaching the breaking-point in
the case of the postmen, as has been shown, it almost seemed
as if the telegraphists must follow their desperate example.</p>

<p>THE PROVINCIAL SORTING CLERKS—THEIR POSITION—THE
RIDLEY COMMISSION, AND EVIDENCE PREPARED—THE
FORMATION OF AN ORGANISATION—THE RIGHT OF PUBLIC
MEETING.</p>

</div>

<p>Through a long course of years the postmen, the letter-sorters,
and the telegraphists had cultivated each their fertile patch
of ground, and produced a plentiful crop of the thistles of
discontent. But there was one other widely-distributed and
important section of the postal community who, while feeling
most of the grievances of which the others complained, yet took
no combined action. While the letter-carriers and the telegraphists
especially assumed a more or less aggressive attitude
in the maintenance and furtherance of their rights and privileges
in the service, the provincial postal clerks, as important a
body as either of these, remained passive till the year 1886.
Through the whole of the stormy and exciting periods, the
strike of the telegraphists in 1870, the upheaval of the postmen
and sorters two or three years later, and the recurrence of
fierce agitation among all other postal bodies during the few
years following, the postal clerks, undisturbed, pursued the even
tenor of their way. That they had grievances goes without
saying; but there were influences that held them in check;
and they did not realise the grievances they suffered from so
acutely as a body that they could be drawn easily into the
vortex of agitation. They agitated more or less for the removal
of restrictions and the redress of local grievances, but their
efforts were too tentative and sporadic in their character to be
of permanent value or make any lasting impression. It was
not till 1886 that an awakening was to come. The postal
clerks as a collective body were content to sow their wild oats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
on the Ridley Commission of 1886-87. That commission, on
which had been centred the hopes of many thousands of men
in the postal service, proved abortive. In spite of the distinct
promise held out and express invitations made to prepare and
tender evidence before it, the Ridley Commission on Civil
Establishments dashed every hope to the ground by prematurely
disbanding. The effect of this on other postal bodies has
already been seen. The abortive Ridley Commission has had
much to answer for, and became in itself the most fruitful
source of that discontent it was originally intended to allay.
When it became evident that it would not after all reach the
doors of the Post-Office, a groan of disappointment went up
from the overworked and underpaid multitudinous army of
malcontents which made up the rank and file of the postal
service; and that groan of disappointment presently deepened
into cries of execration at what seemed so like a wilful betrayal.
That deep disappointment was shared by the postal clerks
everywhere throughout the kingdom; and in common with
other bodies similarly duped, they came to recognise that the
very cause of their disappointment might be turned to advantage.
After all, the Ridley Commission came as a blessing
in disguise. It had provided an opportunity and an excuse
for collecting evidence and preparing the strongest possible
indictment against the department. The evidence thus so
laboriously gathered and industriously prepared was not to be
wasted now. The investigation and the experience had taught
them many things; it had familiarised them with bodies and
branches which had hitherto been held apart, it brought about
an affinitive and friendly cohesion of particles; and small
bodies which had revolved in their own distinct circumscribed
orbit were now given a place and a relationship in a more
or less orderly system. In point of fact it was the means of
introducing among them one cardinal principle, a law, that
of combination.</p>

<p>Previous to the Ridley Commission the postal clerks had
been little heard of as a combined body, but now on this
occasion, with a unanimity that was as commendable as it was
remarkable, they showed the necessity by setting the example
of forming an association. It has to be borne in mind that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
the telegraphists were already combined, but their combination
proceeded from a different origin, though the effect of the
failure of the Ridley Commission was to strengthen their
already existing organisation considerably. It was on the
purely postal side of the service, however, that the most
marked effect was to be produced. In response to the call
for evidence of grievances, men hitherto unheard of leapt into
the breach, and took up the duties of representatives and
collectors of the required evidence most cheerfully. The disappointment
that ensued produced the inevitable result where
no combination had previously existed, and the ruins of the
Ridley Commission were to become the training-ground for a
new army of agitation. The same influence operated everywhere.
The same effect exactly was produced among the
London sorters and the provincial postal clerks. These two
uncombined classes had no intercourse with each other; and
though there was a kinship between them it had never been
recognised. They were like two tribes of one nation, but
divided by seas and continents, and with no telegraphic communication
between them. For all practical purposes they
were almost ignorant of each other’s existence. Yet the
London sorters and the provincial sorting clerks without any
preconcerted signal, and unknown to each other, spontaneously
gravitated towards combination, where no combination
existed before. The provincial postal clerks, however, took
the initiative, and it was not till some few months afterwards
that the Metropolitan letter-sorters, almost unconsciously following
the example of their country cousins, formed the Fawcett
Association on similar lines. The formation of the Postal
Clerks’ Association was preceded by the familiar secret gatherings
and more or less successful attempts at belling the cat at
the various offices. To engage in such forbidden enterprises
in those days was, to say the least, risky; and the promoters
stood to pay the penalty of their rashness at any time they
might be called on.</p>

<p>As Liverpool had taken a prominent, if not the leading
part in the first telegraphists’ agitation, and again in 1881, so
once more, in the case of the postal clerks, was Liverpool to
produce the man and show the way. The deplorable condition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
into which the postal service had fallen, so far as their
working environments, their prospects and pay were concerned,
roused one or two individuals among the postal clerks
here to seek about for a remedy. The cries of discontent,
and the calls for redress from other distant places, came to their
ears like inarticulate voices in the night. From various sources
it was conveyed to them that the same injustices and the
same hardships they suffered from, also afflicted thousands of
others of their own widely-distributed class throughout the
country. The invitation to lay before the Ridley Commission
evidence as to conditions and prospects immediately produced
a thrill of expectancy among postal servants everywhere. From
Liverpool the threads of sympathetic communication were
carried to the different centres of existing discontent all over the
United Kingdom, and the threads were gradually strengthened
each day till they vibrated in unison.</p>

<p>Telegraphic communication did much, and circular letters
did much towards establishing an understanding as to their
aims and desire. Much of the groundwork for their plan of
future action was thus roughly prepared, and it was in these
circumstances that four or five of the Liverpool postal clerks
one day met to discuss the situation, and decide on the
methods of collecting evidence. With the object of fully ascertaining
the feelings of the Liverpool men themselves, and
to judge whether the future movement would be likely to be
led from there, and Liverpool sustain its character for leading
the van, a notice was put up in one of the retiring-rooms calling
a meeting of the postal clerks to more openly discuss the
matter. A meeting was held December 5, 1886, thirty only
attending, however; but it was decided to form a committee
of thirteen. George Lascelles, one of their number, who had
actually set the little movement afoot, was elected secretary.
More meetings followed in the usual course of things, and
the new combination gradually became fixed and determined
in its principles, shape, and character. Its dimensions and
its name were from this time the only things that remained to
be decided. Circulars were speedily got out inviting the co-operation
of other offices, sixty-three of the larger towns being
thus circularised at first. But so unknown were they to each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
other that these circulars had to be posted blindly, and addressed
simply to the “Sorting Clerks at ⸺.” Gradually
the responses came in, the identity of men willing to work in
the new mission was revealed, and a human sympathy and a
relationship as between new-found brothers all at once sprang
into existence. Truly the Ridley Commission had not been
called in vain. The men thus newly brought into touch with
each other, like inhabitants suddenly coming out from the dim
unknown, were invited to send a representative from each of
their offices to a general conference. The conference was to be
held at Liverpool, January 21. The strangers came out from
the darkness; and those who at first were but names now met
face to face in flesh and blood reality, the hopeful pioneers of
a movement.</p>

<p>The conference was held, and proved an unqualified success.
There was an interchange of views, and a mutual understanding
of their wants, on which they were enabled to formulate a
series of resolutions; and on the lines of these resolutions
George Lascelles, the secretary, was authorised to draw up
a general statement of evidence for the Commission then
sitting.</p>

<p>It was decided to band themselves together in the form of
an association for mutual support and benefit, to be known as
the “United Kingdom Postal Clerks’ Association.” Like a
gathering snowball the new postal organisation increased in
dimensions, and rolling onward from Liverpool, presently
included Manchester, Birmingham, and similar towns of importance,
picking up the smaller places like crumbs by the
way.</p>

<p>Within a year the Postal Clerks’ Association had gone over
the whole length and breadth of the land, and extended
from the north to the south, and from the west to the east.
Besides this their association was now represented in four
or five of the most important towns in Ireland. The only
parallel to this extraordinary response to the call for combination
was that among their fellow-servants, the telegraphists,
when the Postal Telegraph Clerks’ Association was formed
in 1881.</p>

<p>The hardships suffered by the postal clerks at this period<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
were as real and as acute as any that beset either of the other
bodies of the service. Their grievances were general and particular.
The hardship of compulsory Sunday labour pressed
on them severely. This question of enforced labour on the
Sabbath had been one which affected the service throughout,
and had been made the grounds of the first agitation and the
first public protest against postal administration. Postmen,
telegraphists, and sorting clerks alike were the victims to this
compulsory system; but with the sorting clerks, especially in
some districts, the evil had grown to exaggerated proportions.
In some offices, for example—Limerick, Cork, Aberdeen,
Norwich, Worcester, and many other places—the clerks, in
very large numbers, were regularly employed on duty every
Sunday, and without receiving any remuneration. In a great
many offices they were kept on duty three weeks out of every
four, and only in a few instances were they off duty more than
two Sundays in every month. It was a grievance with them
that they were compelled to relinquish their day of rest, but
it was doubly a grievance that they were denied payment for
the time and work given. In many of the leading provincial
offices the evil became accentuated, and at Manchester, Leeds,
Exeter, York, and numerous other places where the staff of
postal clerks represented in the aggregate 400 or more, they
were graciously permitted, if the duty allowed, to take a Sunday
off once in every four weeks. When it is remembered that
these men, whatever their religious convictions or conscientious
objections, were compelled to give this time for absolutely no
remuneration, it certainly seemed monstrous in a Christian
land.</p>

<p>This grievance of Sunday duty, however, was only one
among a long catalogue, which had lengthened still with the
progress of time. The system of promotion created a feeling
of irritation and discontent throughout their ranks, though this
was by no means a grievance peculiar to them. As with other
branches of the service also, the gravest discontent prevailed
among them in regard to the scales of pay, but as aggravating
this there was the unequal system of classification, whereby
a clerk in one office might be, and very often was, placed at a
disadvantage in respect to pay and promotion, as compared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
with another at a similar office. The wages of a second-class
sorting or postal clerk were 22s. 8d. a week; but in many
instances their work involved the very highest responsibilities,
including the care and despatch of money-orders, stamps, registered
correspondence, besides payment of pensions, Savings-Bank
accounts, and similar duties. Superior in point of
grade and responsibilities, they were yet, in monetary respects,
inferior to postmen. Not only this anomaly, but junior clerks
having, as was often the case, to perform the duties of others
above them in grade, had no allowance of any description for
so acting; and thus it frequently happened that juniors were
constantly kept, on the shallowest pretext, on more responsible
duties than their poor salaries would justify.</p>

<p>At this time it was the general practice to deduct one-half
of salary when away on sick-leave; and this was regarded as
a distinct hardship, as in no other section of the service, so
far as was known, was so large a proportion of salary forfeited
through enforced absence from causes of illness. They very
justly claimed that a deduction of one-third only would more
adequately meet the case of unavoidable sickness. Another
cause of annoyance to them was the extremely slow rate of
promotion, ten and twenty years being a fair average of the
period of waiting for dead men’s shoes. The analogous
question of superannuation affected them very keenly. The
Playfair Commission of a few years before had recommended
that when a man had given thirty consecutive years of service
and wished to retire, ten years might be added to his time in
calculating the allowance due to him, and that he should be
allowed to resign without either being sixty years of age or
wholly incapable from infirmity. But among the sorting or
postal clerks there had occurred many cases of infirm men
being harshly treated in this respect, and not allowed to retire
either through passing the age limit of sixty years of age, or
being broken down in health. They were in a position to
allege that men had been compelled to attend to their
duties when in truth they were physically incapable of properly
attending to them. Another sore point with the postal
clerks was that a very large proportion of them were unestablished,
though they were compelled to perform all the duties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
of permanent officers better paid, and while they had no
guarantee that their years of service would not be peremptorily
dispensed with by the whim or caprice of an individual supervisor.
Those who were established further complained that
promotions to postmasterships which more rightly belonged
to them as postal servants were unfairly distributed to telegraphists,
this practice seriously diminishing their legitimate
outlet of promotion. These were the principal and salient
features of their indictment against the department at this
period. But there were many other points, such as proper
remuneration for Christmas duty, Bank holidays, Queen’s
Birthday, &amp;c.; the inadequate period of annual leave; “split”
duties, or duties being spread over a large proportion of the
day and necessitating several attendances; the severity of
night duty; and other things quite as familiar to the telegraphists,
the postmen, and sorters elsewhere.</p>

<p>It was to find a remedy for this state of things as
they affected them that the United Kingdom Postal Clerks’
Association was inaugurated.</p>

<p>Then like a thunderclap came the announcement that the
Ridley Commission, whose approach they had so confidently
looked forward to, did not intend to visit the Post-Office at
all. It was a staggering blow to the postal clerks, as it was to
every other body in the service. But so far from demoralising
them, it put them on their mettle the more. Their organisation,
which the illusive Ridley Commission had been the
means of calling into existence, they still had; and they determined
to stand by it, and use it for purposes of defence
and the furtherance of their claims.</p>

<p>For a few years longer the Postal Clerks’ Association, still
growing and consolidating, pushed its claims in the many
various ways known to men who want their wrongs redressed.
But they never departed from strictly constitutional lines; a
few members of Parliament were induced to now and again
take up their case as included in the common postal cause;
they had their conferences, their meetings, their joint petitions,
and their memorials to the Postmaster-General, just as did the
telegraphists, the postmen, and others at this period; still, as
an association, they remained an exemplar to the rest of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
postal service. Their pursuing such strictly constitutional
methods, and their attitude as a combination being practically
beyond reproach, was in no small measure due to the personality
of their secretary, George Lascelles, who was the real
leader.</p>

<p>There was an enormous amount of work done one way and
another; but their efforts towards obtaining any real material
benefit were as fruitless as were those of the other organisations.</p>

<p>Soon after Mr. Raikes became Postmaster-General, as has
already been described, a crusade of agitation beset him from
all quarters, growing fiercer every day. But the Postal Clerks’
Association was not formed for purposes of agitation as agitation;
and it contented itself with remaining as an interested
and perhaps a sympathetic spectator. The great wave of
industrial agitation following in the wake of improvement
in trade everywhere at the beginning of 1890, aroused
the telegraphists, the postmen, and the Metropolitan letter-sorters
to further exertion in their various ways. And
when Mr. Raikes reintroduced the old regulation of 1866,
limiting the freedom of public meeting, the postal clerks
were not behind in lodging their indignant protest, in common
with most other combined bodies. They emphasised
the indignation they shared in holding a mass meeting at
Liverpool, their head centre. Their good manners had so
far not been corrupted by evil communication; but adversity
makes strange bedfellows. There were partial jealousies between
the sorting clerks and the telegraphists, and both to
an extent felt themselves superior to postmen; but in this
they were as one. The Cardiff case gave them no good
opinion of Mr. Raikes; while their minor difference with the
telegraphists was forgotten in their sympathy with them. And,
added to this, about this time they were given an axe of their
own to grind, and the telegraphists in turn looked on with
a sympathetic eye. At the Liverpool Conference of Postal
Clerks, held April 1890, the shadow of the official reporter
obtruded itself across their threshold. He was introduced to
the chairman of the meeting by an official letter, which contained
what was tantamount to a demand in the name of the
Postmaster-General. The official reporter had to be admitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
to take notes, or they had to disband the conference. They
were as helpless as was the official reporter himself, who was
also a paid servant of the department. The chairman of the
meeting, in his opening statement, referred to the fact that
for the first time in their history a meeting of officials called
for a praiseworthy object were compelled to receive in their
midst an unwelcome intruder sent in the name of discipline.
Though there was nothing in the constitution of their society
that was antagonistic to departmental authority, they had to
accept this humiliating and Russianising condition, or forfeit
altogether their right of free speech as Englishmen and Britons.
This new restrictive rule became particularly hard of digestion
to the postal clerks, who had hitherto prided themselves on
the absolutely-constitutional lines on which their organisation
was run. The introduction of avowed trades unionism could
no longer be regarded as a crime in the Post-Office, since
Sir Arthur Blackwood, the Permanent Secretary, himself some
little time before had publicly stated that there was a growing
spirit of this trades unionism which must be made allowance
for and taken into account. The postal clerks had so long
remained loyally constitutional in their attitude, that the application
of the restrictive rule to them they regarded as supererogatory
and unnecessary. However, justified or otherwise,
they were compelled to accept it in common with the rest of
the service.</p>

<p>Only a few days after this the postal clerks were given a
still more serious cause for complaint by the manner in which
some of the officials of their organisation were slighted in the
matter of promotion ordinarily due to them. Mr. Henry
Labouchere put forward the question in the House of
Commons, April 25. The chairman and secretary of the
Liverpool branch of the Postal Clerks’ Association, Messrs.
Thompson and Lucas, were, it appears, unjustly superseded in
promotion by junior men. The fact in itself was not so
unheard of in the service as to call for public comment; but the
circumstances suggested that these officers had been so treated
because of their connection with the association of their class.
The Postmaster-General in the previous March had given an
undertaking in the House of Commons that connection with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
an association or union should not detrimentally affect any
officer’s official career; yet in face of that assurance this
seemed as clear a case of intimidation as that of Cardiff. The
Postmaster-General denied that their being officers of that
union had anything to do with their treatment, and maintained
that their position in this respect was neither known to himself
nor taken into account. Possibly it was so, so far as he
himself was concerned, for at this period, with the bewildering
number of claims and counter-claims put forward from a
thousand points at once, the Postmaster-General had necessarily
to trust very largely to the permanent advisers for information,
and doubtless even for guidance to a ruling in some
cases.</p>

<p>Although at this time represented by two distinct associations,
there appeared to be much in common between the
Metropolitan sorters and the provincial sorting clerks. Their
entrance into the service, the similarity of their pay prospects,
and the character of their duties, entitled the London sorters
to class themselves with their provincial brethren. They had
urged that they were in reality sorting clerks, and were referred
to as such by Mr. Fawcett in his 1881 scheme. But it was just
on this point that the “Luminous Committee” settled the
whole matter against them. The equality that existed between
the provincial sorting clerks and the provincial telegraphists,
it was thought, should find an analogue in the
Metropolitan telegraphists and sorters, and that was the whole
ground of the difference, as already reviewed. Still if there
were not equality in one case, there was in another, for except
in title the pay and prospects and conditions of sorting clerks
and sorters were almost identical; while their grievances were,
except on the enforced Sunday duty question, also similar.
Seeing there was so much in common between these two
bodies, it would therefore not have been surprising had they
made common cause for the purpose of getting their grievances
redressed on a similar basis. It was not so, however, and the
connection between them never went beyond a friendly intercourse,
and the ordinary amenities of unionism. There was,
however, a journal started at this period in Birmingham, intended
mainly for circulation among sorting clerks, but to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
which Metropolitan men were invited to contribute. The
sorters already had the <cite>Post</cite>, which had now become the property
of the association; but the new <cite>Postal Review</cite> was
taken up with some enthusiasm among them. The <cite>Postal
Review</cite> might have become a permanent link of friendly connection,
and a handy vehicle for the intercommunication of
ideas leading to more important results perhaps, but for a
slip that occurred. At the inaugural meeting of the Fawcett
Association, 10th February 1890, a leaflet was distributed
having for its object the promotion of the sale of this monthly
journal, and two of the sorters were advertised as its wholesale
and retail agents for the London postal service. The leaflet,
after announcing that the <cite>Postal Review</cite> had over 300 contributors
in different parts of the country, representing so many
distinct offices, referred to many of these contributors as
“being in confidential positions, and having access to the
most important and valuable information, which,” the leaflet
went on to say, “when occasion arises or exigencies demand,
will be laid before the readers of the <cite>Postal Review</cite>.” The
leaflet in question, so far from carrying out its purpose, was
the means of abruptly breaking off negotiations with the
provinces; for there was an immediate official inquiry, and the
two sorters whose names were mentioned as agents were
promptly called on to repudiate all connection with its publication.
The matter became the subject for special reference
in the Post-Office Circular, and the two innocent men who had
inadvertently allowed their names to be printed on the incriminating
leaflet, were made to thus publicly renounce connection
with it and to disavow all implication in the heinous
design set forth.</p>

<p>After that the two organisations went their separate ways,
and they were not to meet again for some years afterwards.
But though they went their separate ways it was always in the
same direction and along almost parallel roads, and often so
near to each other that they could occasionally catch the
glimpse of their raised banners as they marched towards the
common goal.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<p>THE AFTER EFFECTS OF THE POSTMEN’S STRIKE—THE RAIKES
SCHEME—FRESH DISSATISFACTION—AN ESTIMATE OF
MR. RAIKES.</p>

</div>

<p>If Mr. Raikes’ cautious nature made him slow to convince,
he nevertheless at last came to realise that the rampant discontent
throughout his domain called for some effective remedy
other than coercion. It was not only the continual heckling
in the House, or the numerous public meetings of postal
servants themselves; but, as Sir John Puleston, M.P., himself
a personal friend of Mr. Raikes, pointed out to the telegraphists
at the Foresters’ Hall meeting at which he presided, the
Postmaster-General was himself inwardly convinced that there
were defects in the postal service which called for a speedy
and effective remedy. But while the continuance of postal
agitation everywhere must have hastened the conviction that
something was radically wrong, it somewhat retarded the
application of the remedy.</p>

<p>In the case of the sorters’ agitation, an inter-departmental
inquiry, known as the “Luminous Committee,” sat to decide
on the merits of their claim, and in the case of the telegraphists
particularly a committee of officials investigated and reported
on their grievances. But it was impossible owing to the eruptive
state of the service, and the enormous amount of responsibility
and detail work involved, to settle all these conflicting
claims spontaneously and immediately. The after effects of
the postmen’s strike fully occupied Mr. Raikes for some
months. Another man perhaps would have made lighter
work of it, and allowed the regrettable incident to drop into
oblivion. Not so Mr. Raikes. Physically run down as he
was with the strain of his great responsibilities and the stupendous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
load of work this trying time brought him, even when
he should have sought a holiday, he decided to do all that
was consistent with his dignity as a minister to repair the
losses to the penitent postmen. He early received a deputation
of their body, and promised that he would carefully weigh
every extenuating circumstance which could be urged on
behalf of each individual of the strikers. This same assurance
he gave to the House of Commons during the debate
on the Post-Office Vote, July 23; and despite the warning
of his medical adviser, immediately set to work to redeem
a promise which meant so much to so many. He left
England for a short holiday at Royat, but it was a holiday
full of work for him; for the voluminous papers in connection
with the postmen followed him daily. There is no reason to
think that his inquiry into each painful case was not as conscientious
as he promised it should be, but some doubt seems
to have been raised by Mr. Pickersgill, M.P., and some correspondence
was published between them. The Postmaster-General
mentioned that he had devoted one whole week
unceasingly to investigating and comparing all the appeal
letters and reports bearing on each particular case, “with the
earnest desire of finding grounds which might in any individual
instance warrant a mitigation of the punishment which
all the men had been warned must follow such an offence.”
In the result somewhere about fifty were restored to duty
shortly afterwards, and several others, by the further influence
of members of Parliament, were one by one reinstated.</p>

<p>These were certainly the most serious but not the only
matters occupying the Postmaster-General’s time and attention.
For almost side by side with his investigations into
these cases, and while he was meeting other troubles, he was
preparing a scheme for revising the scales of pay of sorters,
sorting clerks, and telegraphists, in accordance with his earlier
promise. After the adverse decision of the “Luminous Committee”
he had been prevailed to see another deputation of
the sorting force in June, when once more the whole ground
of their claims in regard to improved pay, holidays, compulsory
extra duty, split attendance, &amp;c., &amp;c., was carefully gone over
and considered point by point by himself and the official<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
advisers. Partly as the result of those investigations, and
partly as the result of evidence gathered from other quarters
as to the position and prospects of sorting clerks and telegraphists,
on November 11, 1890, the long-waited-for scheme
appeared. It must, however, be mentioned that the telegraphists’
portion of the scheme had appeared in the previous
July.</p>

<p>It came as a golden argosy that had braved many storms;
and hopes beat high as they proceeded to unload the cargo.
The sorters realised exceptional benefits, adding as it did a
considerable number to the first class, which meant so many
immediate promotions, and increasing the maximum to 56s.
a week, while it also increased the maximum of the second
class to 40s. a week, and the annual increment to 2s. A concession
already personally made by Mr. Raikes, that of increasing
the annual leave of the first class to three weeks
instead of two, was now fixed and ratified, and the first class,
with its additional benefits, was now extended to the districts
which had hitherto had no such promotion to look forward
to. The anomalies connected with the payment of extra duty
were by this revision done away with, and an equitable system
of <i lang="la">pro rata</i> introduced which could not fail in the long run
to give satisfaction all round; while in addition it accorded
Sunday pay for Christmas Day and Good Friday. Another
concession which was much appreciated was full pay during
sickness, “with restrictions.” These were the material benefits
of the Raikes scheme so far as it covered the London sorters.
They perhaps were the most benefited by it; but except for
the material benefits they were not slow to discern certain
disadvantages to which they were to take further exception
later on.</p>

<p>The privileges of payment for Bank holidays, special pay
for Christmas Day and Good Friday, and full payment for
sick leave, were, it was understood, from this time to be
applied with general impartiality throughout the postal and
telegraph services. The sorting clerks generally shared in
these advantages, while those of Dublin and Edinburgh
were placed on an equal footing with their <i lang="fr">confrères</i> at Manchester,
Liverpool, and Glasgow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>The application of the Raikes scheme to the London and
provincial telegraphists, however, was not proportionately
beneficial in point of pay, and fell far short of their demands.
The maxima for provincial male telegraphists under the new
revision were, according to the class of office employed in:
56s., 54s., 52s., 50s., 40s., 38s., 35s., and 32s. a week, as against
50s., 38s., 36s., 32s., and 30s. The maximum of the London
men, which was £190 a year—enjoyed, however, only by a
limited and exclusive class—was not affected; and the only
benefit accruing to them was that the annual rise of £5 was
increased to £6. But apart from the question of pay, the
scheme left other considerations almost wholly untouched.
Classification still remained to taunt and cheat them. The
banality of winter holidays still oppressed them, while they
complained they were not treated fairly in the matter of full
pay in sickness.</p>

<p>And the curious irony of this mixed and complicated situation
was that the sorters envied the telegraphists, and the
telegraphists envied the sorters.</p>

<p>On the whole, however, considering the time and the circumstances
in which it was drafted, it was a fairly good scheme;
but it was far from a perfect one. Not even the sorters,
who benefited most, could regard it as a perfect scheme,
and the less so when they came to closely examine it. The
consideration of the very kindly treatment they had received
from Mr. Raikes, and the desire he had expressed to them to
give them some pleasing souvenir by which to remember his
term of office, took the edge off their criticism. They remembered,
too, that he had strongly urged that their maximum
should be raised to 58s. a week instead of only 56s., and that
he had been supported in this by the then Controller; also
that he had shown a desire to give them practical equality
with the telegraphists. That the scheme did not meet with
their entire approval, or cover all their just demands, Mr.
Raikes was not wholly responsible for. All things considered,
it was a good scheme, and a generous one for the sorters at
any rate.</p>

<p>The telegraphists thought otherwise, and were not slow to
express their deep sense of disappointment. They could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
easily forgive Mr. Raikes for what they regarded as a wanton
and unnecessary interference with their right of public meeting,
and perhaps a far more generous scheme would hardly have
compensated and atoned for the imposition of the official
reporter. The retention of compulsory overtime was a
grievance in common between the telegraphists and the sorters;
but the sorters, who were more satisfied on the whole with
the scheme for what it had brought them, had, if anything,
much stronger ground for dissatisfaction for what it had not.
But when the many varied interests of a vast army of men
had to be considered, perhaps it was well-nigh impossible to
produce a remedy that should fit and satisfy all alike. It
left many things untouched both sides of the service: but
there is little doubt that Mr. Raikes did all that was then
possible, and put himself to enormous pains to understand
and find a final remedy for this well-nigh hopeless problem of
chronic discontent. Having done perhaps all that it was
possible for one Postmaster-General to do for the sorters and
the telegraphists, he felt that something had yet to be done
for the postmen. Almost simultaneously with the introduction
of the scheme for the former, a deputation of postmen
was received to take evidence from them with a view to
constructing some remedial measure for their class. The
postmen were not yet held to have purged their offence;
but the Postmaster-General, after reinstating about fifty of the
dismissed men, decided that apart from all considerations of
the strike, there were grievances among them which as loudly
called for redress as those of the sorters and telegraphists.</p>

<p>There was one other class, however, which at this time
claimed to have been overlooked and neglected, the Savings-Bank
sorters. There was some amount of combination
among them, and they had joined in the general agitation.
They complained of certain anomalies of classification; loss
of prospect owing to departmental alterations; the fact of
the introduction of female labour displacing them, and minimising
the value of their work; females in receipt of better
pay than men with more service, and engaged on the same
class of work; the smallness of the minimum and maximum,
and numerous other things. They had been altogether overlooked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
in the recent scheme, and while the other little Jack
Horners of the service were more or less congratulating themselves
on the plums they had each secured, the Savings-Bank
sorters were left entirely in the cold. Added to this, they
were experiencing in an acute degree the compulsory overtime
grievance, having to supplement their wages with more or less
extra duty—this extra duty being however forced upon them,
whether they liked it or not, often at most inconvenient times.
This grievance on the overtime question was, after their
exclusion from the recent scheme, so strongly felt that at
the beginning of 1891 there was an indignant outburst among
them. They had tried every legitimate method of ventilating
their grievance by petition, by requests for an interview, and
through the House of Commons, but their plaint fell on deaf
ears. The feeling rose so high that at last, as a concession to
their demand, there was a slight addition to the staff to reduce
the amount of compulsory overtime complained of. But it
was by no means effective, and on February 2, two hundred
and fifty of them declined to accept the summons for extra
duty. The result was that nearly the whole of them were
promptly suspended. But they were a small body and standing
almost alone, so that the struggle was of short duration.
The Postmaster-General did not take a very severe view of
the case, the whole of them being allowed to take up their
duties on expressing regret, and promising never again to
offend in a similar manner. The fluctuations of their work, it
seems, precluded the possibility of abolishing compulsory
extra duty altogether; but in April some arrangement was
made, with a further slight increase of staff, by which a number
of permanent volunteers were enrolled to meet emergencies as
they arose.</p>

<p>The position of the postmen had for some months after the
strike been engaging the attention of Mr. Raikes, and on
July 17 he announced in the House of Commons that he had
at last found a means of doing something for them. The cost
of his new proposal would be over £100,000 a year, but it was
to cover a vast area, so that the benefits accruing would not
amount to much in each case: but it was better than nothing,
and more than many expected after recent happenings. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
two classes of London postmen were to be amalgamated in
order to enable the men to progress without interruption from
the lower to the higher scale. The maximum was raised by
two shillings a week for the suburban divisions of postmen.
The auxiliary postmen obtained a slight increase in pay per
hour and a little more extra leave. In the country as in
London the two classes were done away with, and the maximum
raised by two shillings. Extra pay was allowed for Sunday
work, and each hour was reckoned as one and a quarter.
Perhaps the most appreciated concession of all was an allowance
for boots, which till then had not been included in the
uniform.</p>

<p>Some organs of the press regarded these concessions as all
the more magnanimous in a Postmaster-General whose official
path had been so strewn with thorns.</p>

<p>It was the last thing he was to do for the service. His
career as Postmaster-General, so brief, yet so full of vicissitude
and labour, was approaching its close. The enormous amount
of work which the generally discontented state of the service
entailed daily upon him was more than could be sustained by
any one man for long. Even after the repeated warnings of
impending breakdown, he had stuck to his work. He was now
to pay the penalty, and the country was to lose a capable and
a dutiful servant. Henry Cecil Raikes, Postmaster-General,
passed peacefully away on August 24, 1891.</p>

<p>As Postmaster-General, he passed through an exceedingly
trying time; and though it was by some said that he himself
was largely responsible for the troubles in the service, if he
committed some few human mistakes in administration he
hastened to repair them manfully; his bearing as a minister
throughout was dignified and correct. No Postmaster-General
was ever subjected to such sharp criticisms from every side at
once; but no other had ultimately proved such a benefactor
on so large a scale. His remedy for prevailing discontent was
not all-sufficient nor without flaws; but in the circumstances—and
it is the circumstances which have to be considered particularly
in this connection, considering the vast area it had to
cover—it was judicious, and it was not his fault that it was not
more generous. He lived just long enough to know that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
despite previous estimates of his conduct and character, he
was at last to some extent appreciated for the efforts he had
made to do justice even at a time of trying and painful ordeal.
The sorters especially were sad at his premature departure;
and the secretary of the Fawcett Association, W. E. Clery, it
was, who wrote the lengthy, touching tribute to his memory
which appeared in the <cite>Telegraph</cite> the day following the Postmaster-General’s
death.</p>

<p>Henry Cecil Raikes was democratic enough in principle,
though inclined to be autocratic in rule. He was a capable
man, and a leader born; but the restrictions of his office kept
many of his higher qualities in abeyance. If his administration
could not always be considered strictly just, it was in part
probably owing to influences over which he had little control.
Being in the position he was, he was often compelled to identify
himself with and take responsibility for the actions of others.
Nor was this due to any weakness in the man so much as to
the adamantine and tapebound rules of officialdom’s etiquette
and to other causes and relations which may not here be mentioned.
His son, in his “Life and Letters of Henry Cecil
Raikes,” points out that, so weary of it all, the cares of his office
and the curbs on his independence of action, did he become
that he was strongly inclined to resign his position, till a higher
sense of public duty restrained him.</p>

<p>The telegraphists and others, who felt they had so little
cause to esteem him, could not at the time fully appreciate his
difficulties; but they were to learn later that the Post-Office
could be ruled by worse masters. In his lifetime it seemed
his peculiar fate to fail to win full appreciation either from
those above or below him. But if Henry Cecil Raikes had
been a less honest man, a less conscientious and a less painstaking
man, he might have lived long enough to secure his
due share of that public recognition and reward which is too
often bestowed less worthily.</p>

<p>BENEFITS OF THE RAIKES SCHEME—A MARTINET POSTMASTER-GENERAL—A
NEW PARLIAMENTARY POLICY—A PARTING
OF THE WAYS—POLITICAL RIGHTS OF POSTAL SERVANTS—A
BLOW AT COMBINATION.</p>

</div>

<p>Looking at all the circumstances impartially, it must be
acknowledged that the late Mr. Raikes had bestowed very
substantial benefits on the postal service. In the face of
opposition to his proposals, and despite hostility from several
sides at once, he had manfully tackled the complex and bewildering
problem, and had set himself the task of adjudicating
on the thousand divergent and multifarious class interests. It
was a labour worthy of an intellectual Hercules to seek to
cleanse such an Augean stable as the Post-Office, but he had
done as much as it were possible for one man to dare attempt,
meeting with the growls probably of the watch-dogs of the
Treasury, and with little gratitude from those who benefited
by the result. The late Postmaster-General had, though
chary of it at first, at last set himself to the stupendous task
of satisfying the wants and serving the conflicting interests of
the discontented army under his control. He had set himself
to the task, but he had materially shortened his days for his pains.
Both the London sorters and the provincial sorting clerks were
fairly well satisfied with the result of the Raikes scheme, but
the telegraphists and the postmen were but little satisfied with
their measure of relief, and remained hardly less discontented
than before. The flowers had scarcely faded on the grave of
their departed chief before the mutterings of discontent were
again heard, from the ranks of the postmen and the telegraphists
particularly. It was not so much that they were guilty of ingratitude
as that their grievances as Government servants so
far outmeasured the well-intentioned remedy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>Shortly before his death Mr. Raikes had outlined in the
House of Commons the revision he intended to bring in for
the London and provincial postmen. But when the scheme
came to be applied it was found that the London town postmen
did not fairly participate, that in fact there was no rise in
wages for them, their action in regard to the ill-starred Postmen’s
Union and the strike period being considered deserving
of punishment by exclusion from benefits. The discontent
consequent on this had brought about, just before Mr. Raikes’s
death, the suggestion for another experiment at organisation,
and on August 15, 1891, a large and enthusiastic gathering of
postmen met to condemn the revised scales of pay recommended
by the Departmental Committee and recently adopted
by the Postmaster-General. At this meeting a resolution was
carried which led to the immediate formation of a Postmen’s
Federation of town and provincial men, C. Churchfield being
appointed general secretary, and A. F. Harris treasurer. The
provisional committee at once issued a manifesto to all postmen,
inviting London offices to send delegates to a meeting on
September 19, 1891, to elect an executive. The conference
was held, and the executive formed. The executive of the
newly-formed Postmen’s Federation worked with a will, and
obtaining for themselves the right enjoyed by the sorters, that
of free meeting outside Post-Office buildings, a series of meetings
was started in every part of London. Having as yet no
organ of their own by which to establish a means of communication
with the various branches, they approached the Fawcett
Association with a view to the <cite>Post</cite> being placed at their disposal.
The monthly report of progress among the postmen
appeared in the <cite>Post</cite> regularly up to June 1892, when the
<cite>Postmen’s Gazette</cite> was started. On September 16 of the same
year the first annual conference of the Postmen’s Federation
was held, W. Rouse, an E.C. postman, and long known as a
powerful advocate of their claims, being elected president.
Thirty-three London and thirty-eight provincial men attended
this conference. They adopted a programme which consisted
of a claim for a 20s. minimum, with a yearly increment
of 2s. and a maximum of 40s. a week in all towns
where fifty or more postmen were employed; three weeks’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
holiday; eight hours’ work within a twelve hours’ limit;
and the abolition of stripes on condition that the maximum
rate of pay be raised to 40s. A national petition was
soon afterwards drafted, which contained in addition a claim
for exemption from parcel-post work as then combined
with ordinary letter-carrying duties; unestablished auxiliaries
and rural postmen to be merged into the established
force; citizen rights; and an improved Superannuation Act
for all postmen. This programme was distributed to over five
hundred towns. About two hundred and fifty towns adopted
the programme completely and subscribed to the national
petition based thereon. The new Postmaster-General’s reply
was unequivocal refusal to all the points raised. That, however,
was not exactly the first move in the game of postal chess
which Sir James Fergusson, as Mr. Raikes’s successor, had sat
down to play.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the sorters already had come to realise that whatever
the benefits vouchsafed to them by the provisions of the
Raikes scheme, they still suffered disabilities sufficient to
entitle them to make a further effort to gain their removal.
Sir James Fergusson had come to them with the reputation of
a stern disciplinarian, but that did not accuse him of want of
justice. As the result of much deliberation and a general
meeting, a memorial was drawn up and presented February 18,
1892. The memorial, in pleading for an interview, stated that
the object was to urge (1) that the London sorting force may
be placed in, at the least, an equal position as regards scales
of pay, &amp;c., with the telegraphists at the Central Station; (2)
that they be designated “sorting clerks” instead of “sorters”;
(3) that they may be eligible for promotion to higher positions,
including clerkships; and (4) that the number of higher appointments
be regulated strictly according to the number of
duties corresponding. Sir James Fergusson’s reply was in the
negative on every single count, nor would he grant an interview
on any pretence. He issued an official circular, March 25,
1892, to the staff reminding them of the benefits already procured
to them by Mr. Fawcett and Mr. Raikes, and expressing a regret—clearly
intended as a rebuff—that they should reiterate
their claims, which were so fully answered by his predecessor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>To the refusal of the Postmaster-General the Fawcett Association
drew up a reply, respectfully expressing dissent from
the view taken of their case, reiterating their claims, and urging
that, while they were not unmindful of the material advantages
lately gained by many of those they represented, they were
none the less convinced that many of those concessions, with
the additions they now asked for, should have been conceded
years earlier. They trusted that their renewed request for
investigation would not be thought unreasonable, or other
than in the interest of the public service. This was signed
and forwarded, May 6, by the committee of the Fawcett
Association on behalf of the London sorting force. This met
with scant courtesy, and a few days afterwards it was intimated
to them that Sir James Fergusson directed that they be
informed that his previous reply was to be taken as final, that
the reiteration of requests which after full consideration had
been refused, and the objectionable tone adopted, presumably
because of that, was an abuse of the privilege of presenting
memorials to the head of the department.</p>

<p>The uncompromising attitude taken up by the Postmaster-General
caused the sorters to strike out a new line of policy
from that moment. Clery had become impatient of the slow
and unsatisfactory methods of pressing their claims on the
attention of the department. The methods had availed them
well with Mr. Raikes, but in Sir James Fergusson they soon
had to recognise a master of a different calibre. It was not
only the slowness of the hackneyed method of seeking redress
with almost the certainty of refusal that decided them on their
course of action. There were other things in addition. The
general attitude of the officials towards them and their organisation
had undergone a marked change almost from the moment
that Sir James Fergusson set foot in St. Martin’s-le-Grand.
One of the first acts was to prohibit the distribution of the
<cite>Post</cite>, their official organ, within Post-Office buildings, and there
was a growing and well-grounded suspicion that it was the first
expression of a desire to smash the union of postal employés.
There were indeed a hundred different influences in evidence
everywhere about them which decided the most impulsive of
their members to urge the immediate adoption of a vigorous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
Parliamentary policy and to press for a Committee of Inquiry
into the Post-Office. If such a policy was not novel, it was a bold
one. Clery himself, three or four years before, had advocated
such a policy, and it was only owing to the conciliatory treatment
meted out to them by Mr. Raikes that its further consideration
was so long shelved. There were serious differences of opinion
between the chairman of the association, J. H. Williams,
and a section of the committee in regard to this question.
Williams’s colder, more cautious nature put him in opposition
to the more daring line of policy in which he discerned strong
possibilities of personal risk to those adopting it. No man
could suspect Williams of want of nerve; he had proved his
high courage sufficiently; it was only that he thought the old
and more familiar methods the safer, and probably the surer.
Clery, the more impetuous, eventually gained over by far the
greater following to his own way of thinking, and in the result
the question was definitely settled at a general meeting, June
15, 1892. At this meeting it was resolved “that immediate
action be taken to secure from Parliamentary candidates a
pledge to support a motion for a Parliamentary Committee of
Inquiry.” This was carried with enthusiasm, and practically
unanimously.</p>

<p>The association had now entered on one of the most
important steps in the history of postal trades-unionism.
Clery on this occasion for the first time occupied the chair,
Williams being absent. After the general meeting there were
but few dissentients to the policy; and Williams, with deep
regret, though with firm resolve that his view was the correct
one, felt constrained under the circumstances to relinquish
the leadership. On the adoption of such a policy, to which he
was opposed, his position as chairman was no longer possible,
and much as the members shared his regret at the necessity of it,
Williams laid down the epaulettes he had worn with so much
distinction, and resigned his commission. From that moment
the chairmanship was by unanimous approval filled by W. E.
Clery, and the recognised leadership fell into his hands, while
the secretaryship vacated by him was taken up by W. B.
Cheesman of the Western District Office. Clery was now the
recognised leader of the association, but as a matter of fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
for a considerable time previously his strong personality had
marked him as the virtual leader when the moment arrived for
more decisive action.</p>

<p>In view of the impending General Election, presumably
the Postmaster-General took the association’s adoption of
the new line of policy as a challenge to his administrative
authority, for almost immediately afterwards a Post-Office
Circular, dated June 17, 1892, was issued as special
information for postal servants. The Postmaster-General
desired to warn Post-Office servants that it “would be
improper for them, whether in combination or otherwise, to
extract promises from candidates for election to the House of
Commons with reference to their pay and position.” No
small amount of curiosity was at first felt at its introduction
on the notice-boards of the General Post-Office, but immediately
a whip was issued to the members of the association by
W. E. Clery, the newly-elected chairman, which was as decisive
as it was prompt. If Sir James Fergusson’s new order
was intended to intimidate, it did not have the desired result.
The Postmaster-General had only just stated in the House of
Commons that “there is no Act of Parliament regulating such
a matter,” yet he had suddenly made a law unto himself.
Within an hour or so of the appearance of the Post-Office
Circular containing this order or instruction from the departmental
head, the following whip was sent the round of the
association:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The notice in the current number of the Post-Office
Circular does not affect the policy of the association.</p>

<p class="right">(Signed) “<span class="smcap">W. E. Clery</span>, <i>Chairman</i>.”</p>

</div>

<p>Accordingly within the next few days, the General Election
being now close at hand, a letter as from the Fawcett
Association was addressed to Parliamentary candidates all
over the country. The circular-letter stated that, in accordance
with the resolution passed at the general meeting of
their members, they begged to lay before the Parliamentary
candidate a brief statement of facts in explanation and support
of the position they had adopted, and soliciting an early and
definite reply to this question: “Will you, in the event of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
your being elected a member of Parliament, support a motion
for the appointment of a Parliamentary Committee of Inquiry
into the Post-Office, such as was advocated by Earl Compton,
and largely supported during a recent session of the House of
Commons?”</p>

<p>The circular went on to disavow any intention on their
part to act otherwise than as ordinary citizens in the enjoyment
of the franchise; and to offer the assurance that it was
only because they believed such an inquiry would put an end
to discontent in the postal service that they felt it their duty
to thus ask for Parliamentary support. This circular was
signed by W. E. Clery, as chairman, and W. B. Cheesman, as
secretary. The circular was at once a means of canvassing
public support and sympathy, and a protest against the interference
with their public rights and public duties as citizens.
It was a protest against being taken back to the days when Mr.
Monk, the member for Gloucester, fought for them a strenuous
uphill battle of years to obtain what was now so lightly to be
taken from them. In thus exercising their right as citizens in
approaching Parliamentary candidates, they were doing so not
only in their own behalf but in the interest of every other
class in the postal service throughout the United Kingdom,
embracing the telegraphists, the sorting clerks, the Savings-Bank
men, the postmen, themselves, and others. And they
were doing so totally irrespective of party bias or motive.
Within a few days replies from candidates, for the most part
favourable, poured in by the hundred; and presumably not
one of the politicians thus replying saw anything reprehensible
in their being thus approached by postal servants in search of
a legitimate inquiry into their alleged grievances. Among
the successful Parliamentary candidates who favourably replied
were the names of many who were to undertake much work
in the future in furtherance of postal claims. These included
Sir Albert Rollit, Mr. James Rowlands, Mr. Naoroji, Mr.
Cremer, Mr. Keir Hardie, Mr. James Stuart, and that sturdy
veteran of previous postal campaigns, Mr. Geo. Howell; while
occurring in the list were the names of Mr. John Burns, Mr.
Thomas Burt, Mr. Pickersgill, and a number of other eminent
and equally well-known public men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>The provincial male telegraphists had in the meanwhile
issued a precisely similar circular to Parliamentary candidates,
and Sir James Fergusson marked his disapproval of such action
by specially calling attention to it in the House on June 14.
The circular emanating from the telegraphists he quoted at
some length, and, referring to the fact that the sorting branch
of the service had adopted the same proceedings on the eve
of a General Election, he strongly condemned their action as
improper. He appealed to the members of the House to
decline to give any such pledge as was solicited, and stated
that he had the member for Midlothian (Mr. Gladstone) and
the member for Derby (Sir William Harcourt) in full agreement
with his observations. Mr. Geo. Howell strongly criticised
the attitude taken up by the Postmaster-General, and
stoutly contended for the right of postal servants to combine,
and further to carry out all the legitimate functions and obligations
of combination. He was supported by Mr. Lawson
and Mr. Story.</p>

<p>It was hoped by the rank and file of postal servants
that the Postmaster-General, Sir James Fergusson, would
sustain a defeat at the poll; but North-East Manchester sent
him back to the House of Commons, and for a time to
his place at St. Martin’s-le-Grand, by a narrow majority of
110. Sir James Fergusson temporarily resumed his position
as head of Post-Office affairs on July 18, immediately after
the result of the election was known, and he as immediately
made his presence felt. The very same day he reassumed
office he called on the chairman and secretary of
the Fawcett Association to explain their action in regard to
signing and sending out the circular to Parliamentary candidates.
In explaining their conduct, they took up the very
natural position that they were simply carrying out the
instructions of a general meeting, and had acted in a representative
capacity; that they had been careful not to transgress
the official warning as expressed by the Postmaster-General;
and that they had been careful not to solicit pledges relative
to their duties and pay. They thought that in the absence of
any official order, and in view of the fact that they had been
allowed to carry out the behest of their constituents, they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
justified in thinking they had not contravened any official rule,
since no intimation of such had been conveyed to them. On
July 22 the Postmaster-General gave his decision on their
case, which was that for their “insubordination” they be
dismissed the service. This was a direct blow at the very
root of representative principle, and the strongest rebuff that
the spirit of trades unionism had yet sustained; besides, it
had in one moment reduced the franchise for postal servants
to the flimsiest mockery. The blow was regarded as so unnecessary
and so unjust that there was an immediate outcry
against it both from within the walls of the Post-Office and from
without. To have been consistent, the Postmaster-General
should have dismissed the whole body of sorters who were
responsible for the instruction acted on. In twenty-four
hours practically the whole of the London sorting force, Chief
Office men and District men, had signed a memorial to the
Postmaster-General, asking his reconsideration of the dismissals
on the ground that they fully identified themselves with the
policy adopted and the instruction given Clery and Cheesman
as two officers of their association. Not only from the class
directly affected, but from the postmen, the postal clerks all
over the country, the telegraphists, and others, came an almost
unanimous cry of indignation and disapproval. And this indignation
was echoed with surprising unanimity by the press,
both Tory and Liberal joining in condemning Sir James
Fergusson’s action as intolerant and unjustifiably severe.
Even the few organs that were induced to say a word in
favour of the Postmaster-General’s action, based their conclusions
for the most part on the supposition that insubordination
had been committed; whereas there was no insubordination,
and no contravening of any known existing rule of the department
in asking merely for a public inquiry. Others, while
opining that discipline must be maintained in a great public
department of State, nevertheless agreed that it was neither
fair nor constitutional that the political rights of citizens
should in this free country be at the mercy of official caprice.</p>

<p>The Fawcett Association promptly carried the question one
step further, and obtained counsel’s opinion that the action of
Sir James Fergusson was illegal and unconstitutional, a view<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
in which Sir Charles Russell, the present Lord Chief-Justice,
fully concurred, as did also Mr. S. D. Waddy, Q.C., M.P.</p>

<p>Yet despite all appeals, all arguments, and all criticism, Sir
James Fergusson stuck to his position with the dogged pertinacity
of an old-time soldier and a martinet. Rightly or wrongly,
he had taken the step, and he owed it to his pride and his
reputation to stand by it. And he stood by it, a solid rock of
obstinacy against which the waves of protest splashed in vain.</p>

<p>The dismissed chairman and secretary of the Fawcett
Association remained in their respective offices, and the members
of the organisation rallied round them stronger than
ever. There was a feeling that they had been made the
martyrs of an injustice for their sakes and for promoting their
cause, and they stood by them to a man.</p>

<p>The case of the dismissals, involving as it did the question of
the right of combination in the Post-Office, occasioned no little
public comment at the time, and the interest was to an extent
kept alive by the publication of a brochure by W. E. Clery, entitled
“Civil Servitude,” containing a full and detailed statement
of the facts. The General Election by this time was over, and
political fate had given her decision in favour of the Liberal
party. Sir James Fergusson, therefore, was now reduced to a
passing shadow; but it was still hoped by many that, like a
repentant political sinner, he would use his last few hours
of office in retrieving the great mistake that had certainly
damaged his popularity with the service for evermore. But Sir
James Fergusson chose to leave office with the cry for justice
still ringing in his ears, and pursuing him even in the House
of Commons. On August 9, Mr. Sam Woods took up the
matter of the arbitrary dismissals by asking the Postmaster-General
if it were not possible on reconsideration to reinstate
the two officials. Sir James Fergusson was most aggressive in
his replies, and stated, amidst the cheers of his own party,
that he did not intend to reinstate the two dismissed representatives
of the sorters; nor would he withdraw the warning
to Post-Office servants on the subject. Mr. Cobb, M.P.,
bearing on the same subject, put questions which implied that
higher officials of the Inland Revenue had been guilty of circularising
candidates on personal matters, but Sir James Fergusson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
was possibly saved from awkward admissions by the ruling
of the Speaker that the question could not stand. The trades
unionists of the country were particularly strong in their sympathy
towards the two dismissed leaders of postal combination;
and expressions and resolutions of sympathy poured in upon
them from every part. There were resolutions expressive of
sympathy with the Fawcett Association, and of condemnation
of Sir James Fergusson; and amidst a perfect shower of such
trades-union condemnations the Postmaster-General in the
middle of August departed from the stage to make way for
his Liberal successor. If the villain had now been cut out of
the piece, all hopes were centred on the new-comer as the
hero.</p>

</div>

<p>The closer relationship between the postmen and the sorters,
which it was hoped would become stronger and permanent,
was broken off in June 1892. The postmen, besides not
being in full agreement with the sorters on the Parliamentary
policy, had now become strong enough to walk alone without
any assistance, and struck out an independent line for themselves.
They were fast recovering from the terrific blow sustained
by the strike, and many of their dismissed comrades
had been one by one reinstated through the indefatigable
efforts of Mr. George Howell, M.P., who, both in the House
and privately, worked hard for this end. It was owing to a
vigorous attack on Sir James Fergusson in relation to his
obduracy in this particular that he was caricatured in <cite>Punch</cite>
for his pains. The postmen continued to make headway with
their organisation. They were no longer beholden to the
columns of the <cite>Post</cite>, having started an organ of their own, the
<cite>Postman’s Gazette</cite>, June 1892. The <cite>Postman’s Gazette</cite> immediately
proved of great assistance in disseminating the principles
of their union among county and provincial men, and within
a few months the gratifying result was shown in a membership
of over seven thousand.</p>

<p>While the postmen’s organisation was thus pursuing the even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
tenor of its way, and waxing prosperous now that it had once
more got on the smooth metals of a constitutional line of action,
the postal clerks and the telegraphists were not idle. Soon
after the introduction of the Raikes scheme, their disappointment
with its provisions found vent in the preparation of a
petition to the Postmaster-General; but his unlooked-for
death, of course, prevented its being carried forward at the
time. But shortly after Sir James Fergusson’s appointment
application was made that he should receive a petition from
the executive of the Postal Clerks’ Association on behalf of
their class generally. In reply, a request was sent from the
Secretary for a statement of their grievances, and this was duly
submitted the day following. They were then met with the
refusal of the authorities to receive petitions from an organised
association not recognised by the department. For a while
the postal clerks strove to obtain official recognition of their
association, but to no purpose. The original petition was then
printed and forwarded from each branch individually.</p>

<p>The postal clerks, like the postmen, had by this time recognised
the necessity for a representative organ, and accordingly,
in the same month, the <cite>Post-Office Journal</cite> was started, June
20, 1892. Owing to its similarity in title to the official Post-Office
Circular, the department lodged an objection, so that
the organ of the postal clerks had to be altered to the <cite>Postal
Journal</cite> in March 1893. The postal clerks were prompt to
recognise the blow that had been delivered against combination
in the Post-Office by the dismissals of the chairman and
secretary of the Fawcett Association, and one of the very first
uses to which they put their new organ was to protest most
strongly against what appeared to be an attack on the fundamental
principle on which all postal organisations based their
existence.</p>

<p>With the advent of the Liberal Postmaster-General, Mr.
Arnold Morley, it was confidently expected that the wrong
done by his predecessor would at once be righted. Preparations
were immediately set afoot, therefore, to acquaint Mr.
Arnold Morley with this their principal demand, the reinstatement
of their wrongfully-dismissed leaders.</p>

<p>In the meantime W.E. Clery was making hay while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
sun shone, and making the most of his new-found release from
bondage by ventilating his own and the sorters’ grievance before
the public. To this end he went to Newcastle on the eve of
the election there, and arranged for a meeting of postal and
other civil servants; and it was sought to obtain the Postmaster-General’s
sanction for the meeting to be held. Mr. Arnold
Morley, however, merely sent a stereotyped telegram to the
effect that those of the Newcastle staff who desired the meeting
must forward application to him through the local postmaster.
It had been hoped that the required answer to Sir
James Fergusson could have been given in a public meeting of
civil servants. The Postmaster-General’s reply and the manner
of it were the first indication that it was not a change of methods
but only of men. The public meeting convened by Clery was
held August 31, 1892, and the late Postmaster-General and
his successor in office came in for some free criticising. Mr.
John Morley was the Liberal candidate for Newcastle in this
election, and it was as much with a view to buttonholing the
party chief as of holding the meeting that Clery had come
down from London. He met Mr. Morley by appointment to
discuss two points indicated by him in his request for an
interview; the question of civil rights for civil servants, and the
means of dealing with discontent in the Post-Office. Mr.
John Morley expressed himself very fairly and very freely on
the two vexed questions, and promising to support the demand
for inquiry, led his interviewer to believe that he had no sort
of sympathy with the action of the late Postmaster-General.
This attitude of the Liberal leader was taken as setting a good
example to his namesake at St. Martin’s-le-Grand; and a manifesto
to the civil and postal servants of Newcastle was issued the
same day by W. E. Clery, in which he urged that they, as
Government servants, had no option but to vote for Mr.
Morley and do their best to secure his return. There were
five hundred Civil Service voters in Newcastle, and in Civil
Service circles it is held that this manifesto secured the return
of the author of the famous “Newcastle programme.” It
should be stated here that Mr. Pandeli Ralli, Mr. Morley’s
opponent, declined Clery’s request for an interview.</p>

<p>The question of the dismissals was now becoming widely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
public, and Clery himself spared no pains to advertise the fact
of the harsh and unmerited dismissal of himself and Cheesman
from that “civil servitude” which they were only seeking to
improve up to the level of model employment. The London
Trades Council adopted a resolution urging the new Postmaster-General
to reinstate the chairman and secretary of the
sorters’ organisation. But the Liberal Postmaster-General
evidently felt himself bound by the decision of his Tory predecessor,
and declined to reinstate in the service officers who
had been dismissed for “conduct directly subversive of discipline.”
At the same time the Postmaster-General claimed
to reserve “to himself the right of considering on its merits the
general question of the rights of civil servants in regard to the
electoral franchise.” Clery immediately seized on this as an
opportunity of approaching Mr. Gladstone, and drew his attention
to it in a letter. The dictatorial attitude taken up by Mr.
Arnold Morley over this question of the franchise was by
many interpreted as a menace. Postal and civil servants had
hitherto been under the impression that no electoral disabilities
now remained which any minister desiring to hamper the freedom
of election might take advantage of legally. And as this
was a vexed question concerning at least 200,000 electors in
the Government service, Mr. Gladstone, as Prime Minister,
was asked to give some information. As the important concession
of free and unrestricted public meeting for postal
servants afterwards granted by the Prime Minister was undoubtedly
resultant on the action taken by W. E. Clery, the
text of his letter to Mr. Gladstone is here given:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">8 Eagle Court, St. John’s Lane, E.C.</span>,<br />
<i>August 31, 1892</i>.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,—I beg to draw your attention to what purports to be
the reply of the Postmaster-General to a resolution adopted by
the executive of the London Trades Council. In this letter,
written by the secretary to the Post-Office, it is stated that Mr.
Morley reserves ‘to himself the right to consider on its merits
the question of the position of the servants of the Post-Office
in respect to the Parliamentary franchise.’ I beg to ask if, in
your opinion, Mr. Arnold Morley has any right of interfering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
with the exercise of the Parliamentary franchise by his subordinates;
if so, from whence he derives his power, and what are
the limitations, if any, of his interference? I need hardly
remind you that the removal of the electoral disabilities of
civil servants was effected by two measures. One, which was
passed in 1868, removed all disabilities, and a supplemental
Act in 1874 removed all remaining disabilities. Many, like
myself, are under the impression that none remain now under
which Mr. Arnold Morley or any other minister who may
desire to hamper electoral freedom, may derive the legal power
of doing so; and as this is a vexed question which immediately
concerns at least 200,000 electors in the Civil Service of the
United Kingdom—because the Acts for the removal of
electoral disabilities of civil servants are common to all departments—I
hope that you will be able to favour me with some
definite information on this constitutional problem.—I am, sir,
your obedient servant,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">W. E. Clery</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p>To this a reply was received in the following terms:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">10 Downing Street, Whitehall, S.W.</span>,<br />
<i>September 10, 1892</i>.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,—In reply to your letter of the 31st August, Mr. Gladstone
desires me to say that he will take an early opportunity
of consulting his colleagues on the question raised by you.—I
am, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Spencer Lyttelton</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p>While they were awaiting Mr. Gladstone’s definite reply, the
Postmaster-General carried his pretensions one step further.
A general meeting was arranged for on November 23, to consider
the status and pay of the London postal force, and in
connection with this they forwarded a petition to be allowed
to have their exiled chairman and secretary present. To this
request a refusal was given, and the meeting was therefore
abandoned. From this it was evident that the Liberal Postmaster-General
was determined to drive home Sir James
Fergusson’s sentence of excommunication as far as possible.
But with a view to testing still further the Postmaster-General’s
attitude of mind towards their association and its two ostracised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
leaders, the sorters in December 1892 forwarded a petition
asking for an interview to discuss the matter of their civil
rights and reinstatement, at which Messrs. Clery and Cheesman
might be allowed to be present. This was signed practically
by the whole of the London sorters, but in vain. Mr. Arnold
Morley would not budge an inch towards conciliation.</p>

<p>The policy of reinstatement was from this time adopted
more strenuously than ever, and it indeed became accepted as
the middle plank in their platform. They obtained sympathy
and support in unlooked-for quarters, numerous public men
and public bodies giving encouragement in various ways, and
their persistency in the prosecution of their central claim
elevating them to a position of respect among all trades-union
bodies.</p>

<p>The question of civil rights arising out of the dismissals was
accepted by the Metropolitan Radical Federation for discussion
at a public meeting held in January 1893. It was at this
meeting that the long-waited-for reply from Mr. Gladstone
anent the Postmaster-General’s attitude in regard to electoral
rights was read. But the missive was so unsatisfactorily Gladstonian
in its evasiveness that, beyond implying that nothing
was to be apprehended from Mr. Arnold Morley’s pretensions,
it was difficult of ordinary understanding.</p>

<p>There had been a wait of four months before Downing
Street remembered its promise; and it was only then remembered
by the indefatigable postal agitator Clery rapping at the
front door with another postman’s knock. He wrote again to
Mr. Gladstone, and on January 11 received in reply the
following communication:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">10 Downing Street,<br />
Whitehall</span>, <i>January 11, 1893</i>.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,—I am desired by Mr. Gladstone to acknowledge the
receipt of your letter. He is not at present aware of any intention
to change the legal status of civil servants, or that
public opinion has opened the question of such a change,
which is quite apart from the discussion of ordinary administrative
improvements.—I am, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Spencer Lyttelton</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Gladstone’s reply to the questions put was at the time
regarded as unsatisfactory because of its vagueness, but the
concession of free meeting granted in the following August
showed that he contemplated the act of justice.</p>

<p>Some strictures having been passed on Mr. Cremer, M.P.,
for his alleged refusal to attend this meeting, and the matter
being brought under his notice, that gentleman sent an invitation
to Clery to attend a forthcoming meeting of his constituents
in Shoreditch, so that he, Clery, might repeat his
original charges against him of neglect of duty, &amp;c., bringing
with him “as many postmen as he was capable of influencing.”
Clery promptly replied to the letter accepting the invitation
with all becoming gravity, and enclosing a copy of the resolution
he wished to move at the meeting. The meeting, which
was held at the Shoreditch Town Hall, found Clery present;
and Mr. Cremer, seeing the matter had passed beyond a joke,
introduced him from the platform and expressed the hope
that they would accord him a fair hearing. The resolution
proposed by Clery was “that in the opinion of this meeting of
the electors of Shoreditch, Mr. Cremer should have attended
the public meeting recently held in the Memorial Hall, to
advocate the political freedom of civil servants, or have given
a satisfactory reason for his absence.” The moving of this
resolution in a crowded meeting of the M.P.’s constituents
was the signal for an uproar which was maintained throughout
the subsequent proceedings, opinion and feeling being pretty
equally divided. Whether the resolution was lost or carried
was never accurately known.</p>

<p>But there were other matters also demanding the attention
of the sorters; there were workaday conditions to be improved,
and the growing danger of sweating and over-pressure
to be combated. Mr. Arnold Morley, with all the fair professions
of Liberalism, had in November 1892 been pleased
to receive a deputation from an organised committee of the
unemployed, requesting him to abolish overtime, and to pay
fair wages to all classes of employés, and on that occasion he
had expressed himself as desirous that “the Post-Office should
set an example to other large employers of labour.” As the
Postmaster-General had been known to father such a liberal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
sentiment, it engendered the hope that at least in matters of
internal economy and working surroundings, he would not
refuse to make improvement where it could be shown that
need for such improvement existed. The enormous increase
of business in the Post-Office of recent years had given rise to
new and peculiar grievances and hardships not contemplated
or made allowance for sufficiently in any previous remedial
scheme. It was not so much insufficiency of pay, the method
of promotion, or the pension prospect, but more immediate
and more pressing were the questions of inadequacy of staff,
unhealthy conditions of work, and harassing hours of attendance.
Added to these were the growing necessity for medical
department reform, and the scandal of secret and confidential
reporting. Neither of the schemes of Mr. Fawcett or Mr.
Raikes had done more than touch the outside fringe of these
matters. True, the telegraphists and sorting clerks suffered
from similar grievances, but it was a question of degree of
intensity. No other class of the service suffered to such an
extent from pressure and overcrowding as did the sorters at
this period. Based on these considerations, a memorial was
prepared and forwarded to the Postmaster-General in March
1893. But they had to wait some months for a reply; and
in the meanwhile it was thought desirable to strengthen their
Parliamentary policy, and to foster their Parliamentary friends.
Mr. Cremer, M.P., had forgiven the Shoreditch incident, and
promised to join in with their other pledged supporters in the
House, Sir Albert Rollit, Professor Stuart, Sir Charles Russell,
Lord Compton, Mr. John Morley, and the rest.</p>

<p>Of all their alleged Parliamentary advocates, however,
perhaps Mr. Murray Macdonald was at this time the most
painstaking and consistent. Mr. Macdonald had sought every
opportunity to bring on a discussion of postal claims generally,
but had several times been defeated in his endeavour. It
was then arranged through him to hold a conference of M.P.’s
and postal representatives for a full discussion of the case,
which it was anticipated must presently be brought before
the House. With this end in view, Mr. Murray Macdonald
asked the Postmaster-General privately if he would guarantee
that postal representatives might take part in this conference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
without risk to their prospects or position. But Mr. Arnold
Morley squelched the intention by replying that such a course
would be “contrary to the regulations.”</p>

<p>Sooner than they expected came the Postmaster-General’s
reply to the March memorial dealing with pay, pensions,
hours of duty, conditions of work, &amp;c., and the extra promptitude
of the reply was perhaps explained by its containing
a refusal on every single point.</p>

<p>The uncompromising attitude of the Postmaster-General
served only to stimulate postal servants generally to the adoption
of a vigorous Parliamentary policy, and sorters, sorting
clerks, and telegraphists were now more than ever coming to
join hands on questions of common interest. This feeling
of relationship was perhaps fostered not only by a sense
of common adversity, but by the fact that the telegraphists’
friends in the House were also, for the most part, the friends
of the sorters and sorting clerks. The Parliamentary friends
of the postal cause were now representative of every shade of
party politics, and included men of widely divergent views.
The question of Civil Rights for Civil Servants was one that
enabled men like Sir Albert Rollit, Professor Stuart, Mr.
William Saunders, and Mr. Keir Hardie to stand side by side
on the same platform; and this was actually the case on the
occasion of a meeting held at the Memorial Hall, June 8,
1893. With such advocates as these and many others in the
House to champion their cause, it seemed that the coveted
Royal Commission could not now be far off, or at any rate the
existence of such a solid phalanx of Parliamentary support
must surely overcome all the objections that could be centred
in a single Postmaster-General, even with a more powerful
personality than that of Mr. Arnold Morley.</p>

<p>But in spite of all the combined activity of telegraphists,
sorters, and sorting clerks, things in the Post-Office continued
only to drag their slow length along towards the hoped-for
goal of improvement.</p>

<p>A year’s experience of Mr. Arnold Morley’s administration
was sufficient to convince all postal bodies that they had little
generosity to expect at his hands. While in opposition he
had consistently voted for Earl Compton’s motion for inquiry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
into postal grievances, but as soon as he assumed the reins of
office he as steadfastly opposed it, as perhaps was only to be
expected. The provincial postal clerks perhaps, least of all,
had cause to think of Mr. Arnold Morley as an indulgent
master; for an attempt to petition the Postmaster-General
was the means nearly of bringing about the downfall of their
association, while it was seized on as a sufficient excuse for
reducing and disrating the whole executive. The executive
of the Postal Clerks’ Association, acting for and in behalf of
certain offices, desired to draw the Postmaster-General’s attention
to the fact that various irregular methods were in vogue,
and prayed for an independent inquiry. Mr. Arnold Morley
threw doubt on the allegations, and called on the signatories
to the petition to substantiate the truth of the charges by
giving specific instances of the “local maladministration”
referred to. The executive promptly supplied the demand
for particulars. Then, to their astonishment, the allegations
were judged to be untrue. The executive were considered in
fault for allowing these charges to go forward, and it was
decided that they must be punished by stoppage of increments.
The case of the association’s secretary, Lascelles, was
considered more serious, and he was disrated, in spite of
further overwhelming evidence immediately forthcoming that
the original charges were in point of fact true.</p>

<p>It was, perhaps, unfortunate for Mr. Arnold Morley’s popularity
in the Post-Office that two previous Postmasters-General
had in a measure dealt with the grievances of the various
branches of the service. His economical spirit as an administrator
would not admit of the necessity for further revision,
and he early came to the conclusion that postal agitation had
no longer any justification in fact, and was only being promoted
for personal ends by a few individuals. That he
honestly induced himself to believe so there can be little
doubt, though subsequent events were to prove, possibly to
his own surprise, the utter falsity of his view and the precipitateness
of his judgment. It is necessary to make the same
allowance for Mr. Arnold Morley in this position as for Mr.
Raikes or any previous Postmaster-General, but the sympathy
and kindliness of nature which in Mr. Raikes went to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
retrieve most of his earlier mistakes, and the rare quality
of tact which went far to rehabilitate his popularity at last,
were utterly lacking in Mr. Arnold Morley. His freezing
coldness of demeanour towards the staff who sought to approach
him with their grievances begot the conviction that
if he were not actively hostile to their interests, he had no
real desire to understand their difficulties, because he was
instinctively prejudiced against their claims.</p>

<p>Circumstances, however, were to conspire to bring about
that which Mr. Arnold Morley was from the first opposed to.
As the result of Clery’s persistent correspondence with Mr.
Gladstone, the last shackle was knocked off the right of public
meeting among postal servants, August 8, 1893. From a
postal point of view it was a great triumph of principle. Much
of the agitation of the last few years had centred round this
principle, and it was mainly as an academic vindication of it
that the unfortunate postmen’s strike was precipitated. It was
round the demand for free public meeting and as a protest
against the presence of the official reporter that the agitation
among the telegraphists took the course it did, and nearly ended
in another strike. What was intended as a safeguard by the
department proved in reality a further menace to contentment
in the service, and a continual source of annoyance. It was
well, therefore, when after that careful consideration which he
promised in a reply to the letter from W. E. Clery as chairman
of the Fawcett Association, Mr. Gladstone at last saw fit to
announce the concession of free speech and free meeting. As
Mr. Gladstone’s concession constitutes one of the main charters
of postal liberty, and will become memorable as such, it may
be as well to quote it <i lang="la">in extenso</i>. The Premier’s decision,
delivered on August 8, 1893, was as follows:—</p>

<p>“It is desirable that there should be uniformity throughout
the Civil Service, and that the servants of the Post-Office
should be on the <em>same footing</em> as those in other departments.</p>

<p>“That as regards the Parliamentary franchise there can be
no question that its exercise is absolutely free from <em>internal</em>
interference, although of course subject to the general obligation
which affects the public servant <em>in common with all other
voters</em> to use the franchise for the public good. The only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
restriction by the custom of the public service is that persons
in the permanent employment of the State should not take a
prominent and active part in political contests, and it is not
intended that in the future any other restrictive rule should be
imposed on the servants of the Post-Office.</p>

<p>“As regards public meetings not of a political character,
but relating to official questions, the Postmaster-General has
decided to withdraw the instructions at present in force, but
in the Post-Office, as in other departments, it must be understood
that the right must be exercised subject to a due regard
to the discipline of the public service.”</p>

<p>It was held by the Liberal members of the House to be a
concession of civil rights almost without restriction, and it
removed with one stroke of the pen the reproach that postal
servants were not to be trusted in the same manner as other
civil servants. Hitherto it might be an offence of the greatest
magnitude to invite on their platform any but those still in
the service; thus not only were the dismissed officials of their
associations banned and banished from such public gatherings,
but they dared only at their peril permit the presence of any
one of their numerous Parliamentary supporters. Mr. Gladstone’s
concession now removed this anomalous state of things,
and in respect to the right of holding public meetings they
were, nominally at least, as free as other British citizens.</p>

<p>The recognition of this right could not but have the effect
of bringing the various postal movements in closer touch,
while at the same time it enabled each body to perfect their
internal organisation. As a further means to this end, the
sorters affiliated to the London Trades Council, January 1894,
and thus for the second time in postal agitation a postal
organisation was gathered into the embrace of the general
body of London trades unions. During this time there was
being established a <i lang="la">modus vivendi</i> for future Parliamentary and
public action between the telegraphists and the sorters especially.
Following closely on an interview reluctantly granted
by the Postmaster-General—at which, however, the concession
of full pay in sickness was more definitely granted—there came
a conference of members of Parliament in the House of Commons
to discuss ways and means for inducing the Government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
to appoint a Royal Commission on the Post-Office. A
deputation of members waited on Mr. Arnold Morley to urge
on him the desirability of his promoting the appointment of such
an inquiry, but the Postmaster-General steadfastly declined.</p>

<p>The Postmaster-General’s attitude towards postal combination
was interpreted as becoming more and more hostile, and
it was feared in some quarters that he would act on the
injunction of the <cite>Standard</cite> in dealing with agitation among
postmen at this time, and dismiss the leaders. The brutal
frankness of the <cite>Standard</cite> on the occasion of a public meeting
of London postmen called forth some indignant protest on the
part of postal officials generally, and the postmen and sorters
in particular.</p>

<p>But agitation in the Post-Office was becoming familiar to
the public mind, and the organised labour of the country had
declared sympathy. The affiliation of one postal body to the
London Trades Council had in a measure been a means of
drawing the attention of all trades unions to the merits of the
postal case for inquiry, and was likely to give postal servants
an immense advantage, in London particularly. The London
Trades Council prepared a report for adoption in which the
restrictive system of discipline in the Post-Office was condemned,
and a deputation to the Government recommended;
while, in addition to this, W. E. Clery, the chairman of the
Fawcett Association, interviewed the Parliamentary Committee
of the Trades Union Congress, by invitation of Mr. C. Fenwick,
M.P. With these influences at work, it did not seem possible
that they could remain persistently ignored in their demand
for the searchlight of a public inquiry.</p>

<p>As one result of the co-operation of the London Trades
Council, a deputation from that body waited on the Chancellor
of the Exchequer, Sir William Harcourt, to discuss the rights
of civil servants. W. E. Clery, who had now become a
postal representative on the London Trades Council, was
one of the deputation, and stoutly contested several important
points with Sir William Harcourt. But beyond the publicity
given by the press, little was gained from the deputation.
Sir William promised to consider the points raised and give
a reply, but never did so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>Among the Parliamentary friends who had rendered themselves
prominent in the furtherance of the demand for inquiry
were Sir Albert Rollit and Mr. Keir Hardie, and their services
were recognised in illuminated addresses presented at an
annual dinner of the Fawcett Association, January 10, 1895.
But there was also another supporter in the House, Mr. Sam
Woods, who was to render a signal service, and effectually carry
through what Mr. Murray Macdonald had been only partly
successful in doing.</p>

<p>On February 8, 1895, Mr. Sam Woods, true to his promise,
but contrary to the expectation of many, withstanding every
insidious influence and all overtures from behind the Speaker’s
chair, pushed forward his amendment to the Address. He
had been requested to carry this to a division by the Fawcett
Association, and in spite of the strength of the Government
opposition actually lost only by eight. By the narrow majority
of eight the Government was saved, and from a postal point
of view it was something of an achievement. In whatever
other light it might be regarded, it was distinctly a moral
victory for postal politics. The Liberal press were naturally
very wrath at pushing the joke so far, while for the same
reason the Tory journals were jubilant. The postal movement
was given credit by members of the Government for a desire
to wreck the Liberal administration, and the leaders of postal
agitation were not slow to accept the soft impeachment.</p>

<p>At this time the fellow-feeling and community of interests
prevailing between them induced the postmen and the sorters
to once more try the experiment of federation. The telegraphists
were not included, but the tracers, a small body of
tracers of telegrams, attached to the telegraph side of the
service, were embraced, and the new Postal Service Federation
was formed, February 26, 1895. Simultaneously with this
event came one which was to prove of far greater importance
and significance, the publication of a remarkable letter from
the Postmaster-General to the Eleusis Club, affirming the
right of combination among postal servants. The Eleusis
Club, Chelsea, had passed a resolution calling on the
Government to recognise postal employés and all servants
in its employ as citizens, with the right to combine to protect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
and further their interests without any dread of departmental
rules and regulations to the contrary; and further it was
deemed the duty of the Government to reinstate those who
had suffered in performing their citizen duties.</p>

<p>The reply of the Postmaster-General through his Assistant-Secretary
was calculated to affirm and emphasise the right
recently accorded by Mr. Gladstone, but better still, it
removed any suspicions that the Liberal Postmaster-General
was only waiting to swoop down like the wolf on the fold to
destroy their various combinations. As this, in conjunction
with the Gladstone proclamation, was regarded as a valuable
pronouncement on liberty in the Post-Office, it is necessary
here to reproduce it. The following is the reply:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">General Post-Office, London,</span><br />
<i>February 14, 1895</i>.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,—I am directed by the Postmaster-General to acknowledge
the receipt of your letter of the 8th inst., and to inform
you, in reply, that the political committee of the Eleusis Club
appears to be under a misapprehension in believing that the
rights of combination or citizenship are denied to Post-Office
servants. On the contrary, <em>I am to state there are no official
regulations restricting the right of Post-Office servants to combine
or to meet, when not on duty, when and where they like</em>. In
the same way, with certain exceptions not material to the
present purpose—such as the situation of process-server, rate-collector,
and such like—<em>they are not</em> precluded from serving
in any office the duties of which do not interfere with their
official duties, <em>or from taking part in politics</em>. As regards the
latter part of the resolution, expressing the opinion of the
Eleusis Club that it is the ‘duty of the Government to reinstate
those who have suffered in performing their citizen duties,’
I am to state that Mr. Morley is not aware who those persons
are.—I am, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

<p class="right">(Signed) “<span class="smcap">H. Joyce</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p>Forgiving the pretended ignorance of the recent notorious
dismissals, to say the least it was reassuring, and was the more
unexpected from Mr. Arnold Morley, who had all along been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
credited with a ravenous desire to swallow up everything
in the shape of trades’ unionism in the Post-Office. It is
possible that had the concession been offered by Mr. Raikes,
it would have been offered by him in such a manner as would
have won him simultaneous and unanimous applause. Mr.
Raikes would have offered it with a genial smile, as if it
gave him unbounded pleasure to render this little service,
but somehow coming from Mr. Arnold Morley’s hand it was
accepted differently; it was offered without the smile, and
with a cold and impassive air that indicated official boredom
kept in check only by mechanical good breeding. The
Postmaster-General was too indifferent or too indolent to
make a good actor, so they merely accepted this new concession
to principle as a something thrown to them by an
unsympathetic hand. But no matter how they came by it,
or whatever it came wrapped in, it was thought none the less
a gem, and they came to prize it accordingly.</p>

<p>W. E. Clery, now that he was free from the trammels of
Post-Office life, devoted himself almost exclusively to the promotion
of postal interests through public and Parliamentary
channels. He contributed numerous articles to the press on
postal grievances; he daily interviewed M.P.’s both in the
House and at their private residences; delivered a long series
of lectures on the need for postal reform; and generally did all
those things which no postal servant still in the service dared
openly do. By this time, having become well known as a
writer and an enterprising young journalist, he commanded
no little influence with the London press; and numerous
articles that created a stir were either from his pen or inspired
by him. There had been some allegations of wrong treatment
of a patient by the postal medical department, to which the
premature death of a popular young officer was ascribed. An
account of this appeared in the <cite>Sun</cite>, and immediately there
followed quite a shoal of correspondence on postal maladministration
generally. This was continued for a considerable
time, and the grievances of postmen and sorters were reviewed
from every possible standpoint. Following on this, W. E.
Clery delivered a lecture on the subject matter of the correspondence
at the South Place Institute, one Sunday morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
in March; and a report of the proceedings appearing in the
press next morning, the Postmaster-General was stirred so
far as to direct a denial of the truth of the allegations. Unfortunately
for the departmental case this denial only provoked
still further criticisms, and brought forth an abundance of
fresh evidence, which elaborately proved that Mr. Arnold
Morley had been at least a little too premature in his denial
of facts.</p>

<p>It could not have been want of evidence that stood in the
way of the Postmaster-General’s conviction that the postal
dominion over which he reigned was suffering from the effects
of maladministration. Mr. Arnold Morley may not have been
responsible for it, and he might have remedied it to some
extent if only he had the power; but throughout he weakly
pretended that there was nothing to convince him, that there
was really nothing wrong with the service beyond the imaginary
evils produced by chronic discontent fomented by self-advertising
agitators. Yet from top to bottom the whole postal service
was honeycombed with discontent, and moth-eaten with the
most squalid grievances. It was not only the letter-sorters,
the telegraphists, the postal clerks, and the still more familiar
postmen, who were now engaged in this battle for the betterment
of the service. These had now been reinforced by the
postmasters and sub-postmasters; and the <i lang="fr">crême de la crême</i>
of the service were united with the despised and outcast mail-cart
drivers in a demand for better pay, better hours, and
better conditions generally. In the face of this, Mr. Arnold
Morley chose to put his fingers in his ears and forcibly shut
his eyes. The Postmaster-General appeared to think that
by affirming and reaffirming the right of combination among
postal employés, there his moral responsibility ended. It
was gratifying to postal servants throughout the kingdom to
learn that on April 2, 1895, Mr. Arnold Morley, in correspondence
with Mr. Murray Macdonald, had once again
reaffirmed this right to combine. It so far pinned the department
down, and was a contract it could not decently depart
from in future; but where was the real value of this right,
when the real and painful grievances from which they complained
were to remain ignored? But Mr. Arnold Morley was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
not the first Postmaster-General who had played the part of
Mrs. Partington with her broom. The inevitable was to happen
in this case as in similar others; and at last the growth of
discontent, backed by the sympathy of the press and the
public, was to bear down the barriers of departmental opposition;
and the Postmaster-General was forced to capitulate.
The matter was brought to this climax on May 17, 1895,
when Mr. Hudson Kearley, M.P., moved for a Parliamentary
Committee of Inquiry. Mr. Arnold Morley, as the department
personified, naturally resisted with a brave show of strength,
and then pretending to melt into a magnanimous mood, agreed
to, as a compromise, a Departmental Committee of Inquiry.
The pretence of magnanimity, however, was in serious reality
intended as a practical piece of cynicism, characteristic of its
author, and introduced solely as a means of contributing to
the undoing of the enemy. If the malcontents of the service
would have edged tools to play with, Mr. Arnold Morley was
not to be blamed if they badly cut themselves. And so it came
about that the Inter-departmental Committee of Inquiry, afterwards
to become notorious as the “Tweedmouth Committee,”
was appointed, June 11, 1895.</p>

<p>PROGRESS OF THE TELEGRAPH MOVEMENT—CONSTITUTION OF
THE COMMITTEE OF INQUIRY—ITS TERMS OF REFERENCE—FIRST
SITTINGS—THE AWARD OF THE TWEEDMOUTH
COMMITTEE—DISAPPOINTMENT AND CONDEMNATION.</p>

</div>

<p>While the history of the letter-sorters’ agitation was progressing
towards the point concluding the last chapter, contemporary
movements in the service were passing through the
same vicissitudes, and emerging from similar difficulties in
their process of development. The Postmen’s Federation,
independent and strong, had spread itself over a wide area,
and extended its ramifications throughout all the ranks of
postmen, till it now embraced a vast proportion of the rural
letter-carriers, and numbered a roll-call of 20,000 or more.
The postal clerks had likewise strengthened their movement in
spite of the blow sustained by the deprivation of Lascelles,
their founder and secretary; and by the importation of new
men and new leaders in the persons of Paul Casey, Leo
Brodie, and George Landsbery, their organisation continued
to flourish and do able and useful work in the direction of
Parliamentary inquiry for the general good. The telegraphists
in the same manner had rendered a good account of themselves.
By assiduous lobbying, circularising, and by private
interviewing they had gained over to their side a numerous band
of supporters in the House. The telegraphists had now quite
a respectable literature of their own, their grievances being set
forth in pamphlets and brochures innumerable; while through
their organ the <cite>Telegraph Journal</cite>, and afterwards the <cite>Telegraph
Chronicle</cite>, the merits of their case were kept well to the
forefront by the most brilliant service-writers among them.
The guiding spirits of the telegraph movement during this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
time, and for a considerable period before, were Hall of
Liverpool, Scott of Manchester, and Nicholson and Garland
of London.</p>

<p>But one of the most remarkable effects of the appointment
of the new Inter-departmental Committee of Inquiry was that
new postal organisations, of which the rest of the service
had scarcely ever heard, suddenly made their presence felt.
The Head-Postmasters’ Association and the Sub-Postmasters’
Association had been in existence some time, but they had
conducted themselves with such a studied decorum, eschewing
anything that hinted at the dreaded appellation “agitation,”
that it was confidently expected by many that they would
never consent to lay evidence before a Committee of Inquiry
that was born of sheer agitation or nothing. But they were to
come forward none the less. And beside them, in a motley
crowd, came associations of postal porters, overseers and
supervisors, telegraph linesmen, tracers, writers, and others, a
never-ending line of witnesses, all prepared with voluminous
evidence on the long-accumulated grievances of their respective
classes.</p>

<p>The Inter-departmental Committee on Post-Office Establishments
consisted of Sir Francis Mowatt, K.C.B., Secretary
to the Treasury; Sir Arthur Godley, K.C.B., Secretary to the
India Office; Mr. Llewellyn Smith, Secretary to the Board of
Trade; and Mr. Spencer Walpole, Secretary to the Post-Office.</p>

<p>Thus, with the single exception of Lord Tweedmouth, who
presided, the committee was composed of representatives of
departmentalism, and who, being high Government officials,
could not in human nature be expected to have an impartial
sympathy with the claims to be laid before them. It was a
committee of permanent secretaries of important Government
departments, with whom the principle of economy was the
guiding and paramount one. It was manifest from the first
moment that there was little generous treatment to be expected
from a tribunal so constituted. If anything were wanting to
strengthen this supposition, it was the fact that Mr. Arnold
Morley, as Postmaster-General, in laying down the terms of
reference for the guidance of this committee in its deliberations,
expressly made it a condition that they should be guided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
by the consideration that the “Post-Office is a great Revenue
Department, and that, in the words of the Select Committee
on Revenue Departments Estimates in 1888, ‘it is more likely
to continue to be conducted satisfactorily, if it should also
continue to be conducted with a view to profit, as one of the
Revenue-yielding departments of the State.’” Thus it was
made abundantly clear from the first that sheer justice was not
to stand in the way of all-sacred economy. Things had come
to such a pass in the Post-Office that the Liberal Postmaster-General
was bound to make a show of doing something,
especially as the days of his party were now drawing to a
close. Liberal Ministers had of late made much of the platitudes
which were likely to catch the ephemeral applause of
the multitude, and they had been mainly responsible for the
doctrine that the State should be the “model employer of
labour,” and that the Government should be in the “first
flight of employers.” Mr. Arnold Morley had not shirked his
share of the responsibility of giving utterance to these mock
heroics. If only for the sake of an appearance of consistency,
therefore, it was well to have called the Committee of
Inquiry into existence. By the time it either failed or succeeded
in its object the General Election would be over, and
the responsibility for the acceptance of its recommendations,
whatever they might be, would come as a legacy to the next
Government.</p>

<p>The constitution of the Committee of Inquiry, as soon as it
became known, called forth a deal of comment from the discontented
service it was called on to examine into. The
general feeling was one of distrust from the very beginning.
Both the telegraphists and the sorters were some time considering
whether to trust their destinies into the hands of such a
committee, whose only redeeming feature seemed the presence
of Lord Tweedmouth, generally accepted all round as
honest and disinterested in a judicial capacity. The leaders
of the various associations were especially dubious. It was
not the independent inquiry they had looked for; but then
gradually the feeling set in among the members that, come
what may, the inquiry could not result in rendering their position
worse. They might get nothing; but there was a chance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
of getting something. W. E. Clery of the sorters’ organisation
endeavoured from the start to combat this feeling among his
followers, and warned them that the committee being constituted
as it was, it would be only a waste of time and energy
preparing evidence. He urged that only on one condition
should they accept its authority and its recommendations in
their case; and that was, that the question of civil rights and
the dismissals of their chairman and secretary should be considered
and adjudicated on.</p>

<p>At an early stage of the proceedings, it was sought to ascertain
whether these two important questions would come within
the purview of the committee, and also to obtain consent for
their chairman, W. E. Clery, to be accepted as a witness in
respect to this part of their case.</p>

<p>As the result of a meeting held at the Memorial Hall, May 30,
it was decided to put the matter before the Postmaster-General
as the subject of an inquiry. This was accordingly done, and
the reply, through the Permanent Secretary, one of the newly-constituted
committee, was to the effect that as Mr. Clery “is
no longer a servant of the Post-Office, he will not be at liberty
to appear before the committee which it is Mr. Morley’s intention
to appoint.” The one question which, as a matter of the
highest principle, was of the utmost importance to postal servants,
was to be burked from the outset. The treatment of
this question went far to strengthen the prejudice against Lord
Tweedmouth’s inquiry. The sorters had, however, meanwhile
consented to accept the inquiry, and accordingly prepared
evidence. The sorters’ case was to be taken first. The committee
held its first meeting, Monday, June 24, 1895, and
the inquiry was conducted in Committee-Room “B,” a small
apartment of the House of Lords overlooking the Thames.
The proceedings had all the air of a police court inquiry, and
the court seemed centred in a strong atmosphere of officialdom
imported from St. Martin’s-le-Grand. But it was scarcely
imposing either in its assembly or its surroundings. There
was little to relieve the sombre dulness of it except the red
splashes of colour supplied by the crimson-leather chairs with
their embossed coronets, and the gliding vision of Thames
steamers and barge traffic beyond, seen through the generous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
expanse of window. The grave and reverend seigniors who
constituted the committee were ranged in a semicircle at a
horseshoe-shaped table, and the enclosed space was occupied
by the witness, an arrangement which hinted at inquisitors
and a prisoner in a trap. Lord Tweedmouth as the presiding
judge, and perhaps the chief inquisitor, was a striking figure.
Gaunt and towering even as he sat, the sunlight strongly
reflecting on his curious pyramidal-shaped cranium, his visage
hawk-like, for the most part silent and grim, he seemed like
a great brooding eagle, supported on either side by kindred
birds of lesser personality. Sir Francis Mowatt, with his disposition
towards making ponderous jokes in a dry croaking
raven’s voice, pitched curiously enough, however, in a surprisingly
pleasant key, was perhaps, next to Lord Tweedmouth,
the most striking figure among the committee. The others
were ordinary unobtrusive-looking gentlemen; and the most
unassuming-looking of them all was a rather slight elderly
man, with grey hair and beard turning white. That was Mr.
Spencer Walpole, late Governor of the Isle of Man, and now
Permanent Secretary to the Post-Office. Courteous, bland
and dignified in demeanour, there was nothing except the
mouth, seeming set in a perpetual sneer, to indicate the man;
yet he it was who was to dominate the proceedings from start
to finish.</p>

<p>If postal servants indulged the hope that the vexed question
of civil rights and the cognate one of the unfair dismissal of
trades-union officials would be included for consideration,
Lord Tweedmouth in his opening address made it clear that
it was to be tabooed. There was naturally some disappointment
manifested over this, and one of the witnesses for the
Fawcett Association, E. J. Nevill, gallantly tried by a
manœuvre to get it discussed. Lord Tweedmouth sternly
negatived it, and the Controller of the London postal service,
as one of the attorneys for the department, with prompt significance
demanded the name of the man who had dared to ask so
impertinent a question. It was the presence of this official,
and the way in which he was allowed to openly influence
the proceedings, which largely served to show the real character
of the inquiry, and to weaken the men’s confidence in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
ultimate impartiality. The little incident of demanding the
name of a lower subordinate witness, and the manner of it,
induced the witnesses present, through one of their number,
to get a protective guarantee from Lord Tweedmouth that
none should suffer in their prospects for speaking openly.
That it should have been deemed necessary to seek such a
guarantee was suggestive.</p>

<p>The presence of all the heads of departments arranged in
reserve squadron, and commanded by the Controller of the
London postal service and other officials in turn, deprived the
inquiry of its strictly impartial character. These officials were
allowed to sit apart from ordinary witnesses and immediately
behind the Permanent Secretary to the Post-Office, the departmental
representative on the committee, to perform attorneys’
work, to make suggestions, provide questions to be put, and to
pass written communications innumerable. If Lord Tweedmouth
felt ashamed of the unfair latitude allowed in his court,
he scarcely betrayed it.</p>

<p>In the meantime, either by implied understanding or by the
weak acquiescence of the rest of the committee, the Postal
Secretary was quietly but diligently asserting his mastery over
it. Mr. Spencer Walpole had a reputation as a man of brilliant
parts, and being a descendant of that historic Walpole who
so cruelly used the poor boy-poet Chatterton, and who is
asserted to have laid it down as a dictum that “every man
has his price,” it had come almost as a natural heritage to him
to be regarded as a born cynic. A little of this inborn cynicism
seemed to peep out when asking a witness who and what were
his parents, adding with what was regarded as unnecessary
sarcasm that the witness need not answer the question if
he did not like to. The question was supposedly put for purposes
of comparison, but it produced a rather sore feeling
against the commissioner, and in no way tended to alleviate
the growing conviction as to his unsympathetic attitude.
They knew that Mr. Spencer Walpole was an important factor
to be reckoned with, but they did not realise as yet that he was
virtually the committee. It did not become marked for the
first day or two. Each member of the committee was allowed
to put a fair number of questions to witnesses, but gradually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
Mr. Spencer Walpole’s personality spread itself over the entire
gathering, and it became an acknowledged fact that it was the
Post-Office administration personified in him that was sitting
in judgment on itself and moulding the inevitable verdict.
The Permanent Secretary, backed up by his silent but industrious
force of officials preparing the ammunition that he was
to fire off, took the lead with almost every witness. If it was
thought he was partial, it had to be acknowledged he was
clever; if he was merciless, he was also artistic to an extent,
especially when he forgot his cynicism. The manner of his
smartness, his alertness, and directness in choosing the leading
question and putting it at every opportunity would have done
credit to an Old Bailey lawyer. It seemed to gradually dawn
on two or three of the committee that there was little left for
them to do, so they accordingly subsided, only to pop up
occasionally as if for the sake of appearance. Sir A. Godley
from an early stage of the proceedings was either so thoroughly
bored with the whole business, or so thoroughly convinced that
the verdict could be come to without his active assistance,
that he unblushingly dropped off to sleep, commonly for half-an-hour
at a stretch. The only commissioner who inspired
energy into the proceedings was the most interested party of
all, the Permanent Secretary of the Post-Office, whose administration
it was that had come up for judgment. Not even the
occasional laugh, always in such deliberations eagerly snatched
at as a welcome break in the oppressive decorum, could
deprive the occasion of that air of unreality and insincerity
that seemed to pervade it.</p>

<p>The sorters, introduced and led by Groves, the treasurer of
the association, stated their case already so familiar, and in one
or two instances received the compliments of Lord Tweedmouth
for the clear and able manner in which they had made
themselves understood. That, of course, so far as it went,
was gratifying, and as each representative in turn was questioned
as to whether he was not an officer of such-and-such an
association, it was calculated to heighten the conviction that
official recognition of their organisations had come at last.
The hope, however, was only a temporary one, doomed to be
obliterated by the growing realisation that this was only too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
likely to prove a solemn farce. The witnesses came and went,
sorters, telegraphists, postmen, and others, and in every case
with wearisome monotony came the iteration of that cold, metallic
leading question from the Permanent Secretary—the spare
man with the yellowish-white beard surrounding the cruelly
sneering lips—“But is it not the fact,” &amp;c. The question was
always so framed that the counsel for the Post-Office very
often wrung from a witness a reluctant or unwary admission
afterwards turned to good account in the summing up.</p>

<p>The rebutting evidence of the officials as witnesses for
the department was taken alternately with the completion
of statements for each class or section of the service. The
evidence of the Postal Controller was not altogether unfavourable,
containing as it did some valuable admissions;
but strong exception was taken by the sorters to his denials
of undue pressure in the working conditions, while surprise
was felt that he should seek to justify a lately-developed
system of petty secret reporting and espionage, execrated
and condemned by the staff generally as unworthy of an
English Government department. The evidence of the chief
medical officer was in most respects distinctly favourable, corroborating
their evidence of unhealthy hours and conditions
of labour and the insanitary surroundings of their workaday
lives; and his evidence, so far, in a large measure helped to
remove the bad impression prevailing in respect to the medical
officials’ attitude towards the staff at St. Martin’s-le-Grand.
The telegraphists found in their Controller a very friendly witness
so far as his utterances went, and they felt they had cause
to congratulate themselves; only they had yet to learn that
fine words butter no parsnips. The hostility of the Assistant-Secretary,
Mr. Lewin Hill, nephew of the founder of the penny
post, was blunt and undisguised, and especially displayed itself
towards the postmen, portions of his evidence being received
by them with the strongest signs of dissent.</p>

<p>The evidence of the officials originally intended to minimise
the value of that given by the subordinate and manipulative
staffs, could not on the whole, however, be adjudged altogether
unfair. The authorities had to play the game according to
the rules prescribed for them, and mostly with a view to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
scoring for the department. If they did not play the game
entirely devoid of prejudice, they played it consistently as
witnesses for their department on its defence. The tribunal
itself may have been unfairly constituted, but there were
few outward and visible signs that it was so during the
taking of evidence. The naked truth was as decently draped
as possible. And for the artistic arrangement of the drapery
there was much credit due to the secretary of the committee,
Mr. Bruce, to whose courtesy and considerateness
the host of witnesses owed much in carrying through their
tasks. Lord Tweedmouth was, as the president of the inquiry,
always studiously fair and strong in his judicial capacity; but
he struck one at times as being uncomfortable and pained at
the realisation, that had come too late, that he had been
betrayed into a false position.</p>

<p>If ever it was a case of “Save us from our friends” it was so
with Lord Tweedmouth. Mr. Arnold Morley as Postmaster-General
had lightly and airily granted this inquiry, apparently
with the full conviction that the case of the postal malcontents
was so weak and flimsy that examination would only cover
them with confusion. That indeed was to be the end and
purpose of the whole inquiry; and Lord Tweedmouth, trusting
to the representations of his friend, agreed to risk his reputation
on it. However open-minded Lord Tweedmouth may
have been when he approached the problem, the constitution
of the committee, the terms of its reference, the restrictions
with which it was hedged in various ways, all conspired against
a free and impartial verdict. It is probable that Lord Tweedmouth
was as surprised as anybody to find how complex, how
tangled, and how stupendous was the problem so lightly laid
before him by Mr. Arnold Morley. Whatever may have been
his chagrin at being thus betrayed into the acceptance of so
onerous and gigantic a task, Lord Tweedmouth courageously
determined to see it through to the end. And he did; but
he came out of the fearful ordeal scarcely the man he was
when he went in, and his public reputation, if not sullied, was
certainly not enhanced. If the recommendations of the Tweedmouth
Committee were not the result of a prearranged and
foregone conclusion, the subsequent discontent was largely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
based on the suspicion that it was so. The inquiry lasted for
some two or three months; there was an elaborate examination
of witnesses drawn from every branch and every section
of the lower ranks of the service, there was a very industrious
show of getting at the facts of things, there was some amount
of patience and tolerance displayed, but considerations of
economy were to warp and stultify the verdict to be presently
given. If the verdict had only been in just accordance with
the promise implied in the simulated earnestness of certain
members of the committee, there would perhaps have been
little to object to. But it was not to be. Certainly, few held
optimistic views of the result of the inquiry, but scarcely any
one was prepared for what was coming.</p>

<p>When, after some months of silent and unseen deliberation
in preparing their recommendations, the long-looked-for
report of the Tweedmouth Committee was, on March 10,
1897, issued, it immediately produced a thunderclap. It was
eminently disappointing to the whole Service. The mountain,
after all its long labour, had brought forth a mouse. The many
who had asked for bread were offered a stone, while only to
a few were given some small crumbs of comfort. The new
scheme was to appropriately take effect on the First of April.</p>

<p>An examination of the scheme revealed it to be full of flaws
and omissions; and what it appeared to so generously offer
with one hand it filched with the other. It was regarded by
every section of the service as a clever piece of financial
thimble-rigging. The only class who appeared to derive any
material benefit worth speaking of were the London sorters,
their maximum being raised to £160 per annum; but even this
benefit was found to be minimised by restrictions, while certain
emoluments and allowances for extra responsibilities and
particular duties were to be sacrificed.</p>

<p>The telegraphists, so far from benefiting, were the principal
sufferers, their maximum, instead of being raised as they had
hoped, now being reduced from £190 to £160 uniformly
with the sorters. The postmen, except in the matter of one
or two additional good-conduct stripes, were no better off
than before; while the vexed question of Christmas-boxes—a
source of humiliation to themselves and an unjust tax on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
the public indirectly imposed by the department—was left
untouched. Altogether the Tweedmouth scheme was a source
of still further grievance all round. The provincial sorting
clerks were “bitterly disappointed,” the postmen were “dumfounded,”
the sorters “by no means satisfied,” and the
telegraphists were simply “overwhelmed with consternation.”
These were the verdicts of the various bodies who were
included in the scheme; but several of the classes who had
tendered evidence, in hopes of getting their grievances redressed,
were herein conspicuous by their absence. If there
was a little given there was much taken away. If there was
a slight increase in the holiday period and other minor advantages,
ample compensation was taken in the serious reduction
of the telegraphists’ maximum, and the abolition of allowances
for special and senior duties among other classes, the sorters
and sorting clerks. When, indeed, these reductions and abolitions
were considered, it was difficult to accept as an actual
and literal fact the alleged enormous cost of this scheme,
seemingly so hollow and so empty.</p>

<p>The two concessions to sentiment and humanity principally
appreciated by the sorters and others were the acknowledgment
of the insanitary conditions of the sorting-offices and
the proposed reduction of the rigours of middle-of-the-night
attendance and split duties. But other grievances almost as
pressing were either ignored or glossed over, or wholly rejected
as not sufficiently proved. In spite of the representations that
had been made on every ground of proof that postal servants
were overloaded with work and responsibility; that the growing
strain and stress was a common cause of brain malady and
nervous breakdown; that the conditions of postal life generally
conduced to premature decay, and were becoming a prolific
cause of consumption, especially among the indoor staffs, the
Tweedmouth scheme was to supply no remedy. In spite of the
evidence that the conditions of work and the disgraceful overcrowding
during the performance of important duties were so
largely responsible, it seemed that men were still to be punished
and humiliated for errors next to unavoidable. The Tweedmouth
scheme, moulded within the narrow groove of a mechanical
economy, was to bring no relief for these things. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
charges of favouritism in the service had been scouted as not
proven; but if there were few well-defined cases of direct
nepotism, there still obtained the kindred evil of the neglect,
suppression, and humiliation of deserving merit for no other
reason than that it was not accompanied with the prescribed
abjectness and self-effacement. These evils, and the thousand
and one grievances arising out of them, exhaustively and conclusively
pleaded as they were before the inquiry, were practically
left untouched by the scheme intended to provide a
panacea for all postal ills. Hence the disappointment of all
classes, both those who were included in the too meagre
benefits and those who were not. It was regarded all round
as a scheme more for the department than for the force. If
the department had made a few concessions, it had exacted a
heavy price for them. It had been confidently thought that if
they would not concede they would not take away; but the
result showed that in return for the little that had been given
old privileges were to be ruthlessly cut away and old landmarks
disturbed. The scheme reckoned so costly was found by this
means to partly pay for itself, and even the hours of duty in
some cases were so manipulated as to more than compensate
the department for the three days’ increase in annual leave,
the most costly item of the whole.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary here to go into a close analysis of so
technical and complex a scheme as that embodied in the
report of the Tweedmouth Committee; but such was the
feeling its introduction produced among every class to which
it applied, that it was regarded as an insult and a fresh injustice;
and serious outbreaks of discontent seemed imminent
all over the country. However, whatever the merits or demerits
of the Tweedmouth scheme, the serious fact had to be faced
that it had met with sweeping and universal condemnation,
even those whom it most favoured accepting it only as a
Pyrrhic victory for agitation.</p>

FEDERATION—THE JUBILEE OF POSTAL AGITATION—CONCLUSION.</p>

</div>

<p>During the deliberations of the Tweedmouth Committee, the
attitude of the service had necessarily for the most part been
one of waiting and expectancy. But it was not without its
record of work in the interim. The vexed question of civil
rights and the reinstatement of Clery and Cheesman was urged
in Parliament and on the attention of the Postmaster-General
whenever there was an opportunity. In the previous session
of Parliament, Sir Albert Rollit raised the matter in the
House of Commons for the twentieth time, on a motion to
reduce the Postmaster-General’s salary, but the motion was
withdrawn on a promise of a reconsideration of the question.
Parliamentary policy was, however, almost of necessity during
this while in a passive state, though a hold was still kept on
the numerous Parliamentary friends of the movement. The
connection between the postal organisations and the general
labour movement outside had by this time become more intimate
than ever. The sorters’ organisation, the Fawcett Association
had through its chairman, W. E. Clery, been mainly
instrumental in bringing into existence; the Government
Workers’ Federation started with the ambitious project of
ultimately embracing all classes of Government workers.
Moving along the lines on which it was originally started, it
bid fair to become an important and formidable factor in
domestic politics; but differences arose among the leaders on
points of policy, and Clery having so many demands upon his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
time in connection with postal agitation proper, relinquished
the leadership of it, though the sorters’ organisation still
continued affiliated to it. The chairmanship of the Government
Workers’ Federation was then filled successively by G. E.
Raby, then organising secretary of the Fawcett Association,
and by W. B. Cheesman, general secretary of the same body,
and under the latter especially continued to exert some amount
of political influence. The postal movement particularly, as
represented by the sorters’ organisation, discharged its due
share of work and responsibility in connection with the general
crusade of labour, sending delegates to the Trades Union
Congress each year, holding a respected position in the
London Trades Council, and rendering assistance both moral
and pecuniary in most of the functions of trades union and
labour politics.</p>

<p>Then came the announcement on March 10, 1897, of the
recommendations of the Tweedmouth Committee, and the consequent
disappointment of the whole of the postal service.
That disappointment became the stronger the more they
realised that their confidence and patience, so sorely tried,
had been so ill repaid. The voice of discontent broke out with
renewed vigour, and found expression in public meetings all
over the country once more. There was a general demand
that the whole thing should be thrown into the melting-pot
and recast. Fiercely-enthusiastic and crowded meetings of
postmen and telegraphists were held in London, and among
the latter particularly there were growing warnings of a renewed
disposition to adopt a strike policy.</p>

<p>Certainly among the postmen and the telegraphists the
application of the scheme threatened only to make confusion
worse confounded. Considering the amount of discontent it
had revived, and the manner in which it bid fair to strain
the loyalty of postal servants to the uttermost, it seemed the
Treasury and the Government were by no means to be congratulated
on their bargain, costing, as it was supposed to,
the enormous sum of £275,000 a year. So far from effecting
its purpose, it appeared rather to be producing a spirit of open
and unveiled revolt among the very classes it was supposed to
pacify. A recognition of this circumstance and the influence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
of pressure brought by members of Parliament at last induced
the Postmaster-General, the Duke of Norfolk, who had now
succeeded Mr. Arnold Morley, and Mr. Hanbury, Secretary to
the Treasury, to consider the advisability of a further inquiry,
presumably with a view to some revision of the scheme so
strongly objected to. The fault of the situation lay not so much
with the malcontents, or any proneness to agitation on their
part, as to the innate defects and anomalies of this costly and
cumbrously ineffective scheme; and members of Parliament,
and a considerable section of the press, held to that view in
calling on the Postmaster-General to institute a further inquiry.
It had been urged from every postal platform throughout the
United Kingdom that the scheme, that all servants of the
Post-Office had looked to to bless them, had produced quite
the opposite effect. From the postal servants’ point of view,
the Tweedmouth Committee had acted the part of Balaam
reversed. The scheme, instead of proving the plentiful cornucopia
they had hoped for, and felt they merited, had turned
out a Pandora’s box, full of evils, but with not even hope at
the bottom.</p>

<p>The tide of indignation quickly gained in strength, till
among the London telegraphists their inclination to strike
became scarcely any longer disguised. The threatened strike
was, it was understood, to take the form of a general refusal
to perform overtime, a contingency which, in view of the
already undermanned condition of the staff, was likely to give
rise to serious complications for both the department and
the public, especially with the approach of the busy summer
season. Some of the press in their comments on the situation
were ill-advised enough to assure the telegraphists of their
support and sympathy in the event of their adopting this
course, but there is no reason to think that such assurances
influenced the telegraphists in their decision. They boasted
of being able to fight the battle on its merits, and with confidence
as to the result if they did so decide. There had
already been telegraph strikes, and all had ended with more
or less success for the men concerned. The first was that of
1871 in England, the second was in France in 1881, and the
third was in Spain in 1892. All three were conspicuous examples<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
of what inconvenience to the public could be caused
by a stoppage and dislocation of the telegraph service, and in
each case the struggle was brief. But that was before the
general adoption of telephones. Possibly the telegraphists
who at first contemplated striking against overtime recollected
this in conjunction with other considerations. While they
were making a show of preparation, and subscribing to an
emergency fund started in Liverpool, the authorities were not
slow to take advantage of the warnings, and, none too secretly,
were providing against the emergency accordingly.</p>

<p>On June 15 the Duke of Norfolk granted an interview to
the aggrieved telegraphists, and by a deputation of the London
men was made personally acquainted with the full text of their
grievances. The Postmaster-General promised to give full
consideration to the facts laid before him, and to acquaint
them with his decision at an early date. After waiting for
five weeks for the promised answer, the telegraphists gave
vent to their further impatience by deciding to take a ballot
of their members on the question of ceasing to work overtime.
The result of this ballot showed practically a unanimous vote
in favour of a refusal to obey overtime summonses, the proportion
of the whole country being 83 per cent. in favour, or
fully 70 per cent. of the whole male staff. In London the
vote showed 94 per cent., in Liverpool 85 per cent., and other
provincial towns gave similar results. The ballot showed that
the men were getting angry; but in view of a promise given
in the House by Mr. Hanbury as representing the Postmaster-General,
the executive of the telegraphists announced their
intention to recommend their members to delay for a while
before carrying the intention into effect. There was an excited
mass meeting of London telegraphists, male and female, and
it is probable that only the intervention of Sir Albert Rollit
averted a threatened strike.</p>

<p>The platform utterances in public meeting during this exciting
period were in some cases none too guarded, and, as a
result, two Newcastle telegraphists, and Garland, the secretary
of the London branch, one of the ablest of the leading
agitators, were called on officially to explain certain expressions
used by them in reference to the avowed intention of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
body to “walk out” from the operating-rooms when the signal
came to be given. Their explanations were, however, accepted
a little later on as more or less satisfactory; and this was done
with a tactful exhibition of leniency in a trying emergency
that at the time was favourably commented on in the press,
and possibly did much towards conciliating the telegraphists
as a body and turning them from their intention; though it
must be noted that some little indignation was expressed
among them owing to their two comrades at Newcastle having
their salaries reduced.</p>

<p>Meanwhile petitions and memorials were being numerously
signed and sent in from almost every class of postal servants
pleading for interviews with heads of departments, and urging
the authorities in various ways to remedy the newly-discovered
defects of the Tweedmouth scheme, or to see that its more
favourable recommendations were interpreted and applied
more equitably; for during this time it was observable that
the department showed a marked reluctance to give postal
servants the full benefits the scheme entitled them to, though
every advantage on its own side was almost at once rigidly
exacted.</p>

<p>Little or no satisfaction resulted from these appeals, and
on July 16, 1897, the report of the Tweedmouth Committee
being brought on for discussion in the House of Commons,
the opportunity was taken to raise most of the knotty points
afresh. Sir Albert Rollit was again to the fore, and well
vindicated the claims of the postmen, the telegraphists, and
sorters, and, to promote discussion on the matter, moved the
reduction of the Post-Office vote by £1000. He was ably
supported by Captain Norton, Mr. Hudson Kearley, Mr.
William Allen, Mr. Pickersgill, and a number of other influential
members, the whole ground of the established forces
and the rural and auxiliary postmen being once more gone
into.</p>

<p>As the indirect result of this debate, a conference was
arranged between members of Parliament and the Postmaster-General
and Mr. Hanbury, as Secretary to the Treasury; and
to this conference members of the still aggrieved classes in
the service were invited to give supplementary evidence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
The Norfolk-Hanbury Conference, as it came to be known,
occupied several sittings during July, representatives of the
numerous classes affected giving further evidence. What was
at first hailed as a Committee of Arbitration was, however,
found to be presided over and dominated almost entirely
by the Postmaster-General, members of Parliament being reduced
to the position of witnesses and having no voice in the
decisions to be arrived at. Sir Albert Rollit, as the principal
advocate of the postal case, strove earnestly and strenuously
to convince the Duke of Norfolk and Mr. Hanbury that the
Tweedmouth scheme was inadequate; that where it had not
actually introduced fresh grievances it had but imperfectly
met the just demands of the service; and that the shortcomings
of the scheme were aggravated by the niggardly
manner in which the few favourable recommendations were
being applied.</p>

<p>An additional volume of evidence on fresh points was put
forward by various witnesses called from among the men;
and in many respects it was sought to be shown that the
conditions of the service were far from being bettered by the
scheme, and that many unfair advantages were being taken by
the authorities. At an early stage of the proceedings one
more effort was made to discuss the questions of civil rights
and the notorious dismissals; but it was as promptly ruled out
of order as before. There was a deal of ammunition expended
by the various postal bodies on the Norfolk-Hanbury
Conference, but from certain indications in the Postmaster-General
they were led to believe that he was not wholly
unsympathetic. They had, however, to wait for a period of
seven months for the second instalment of their great disappointment.</p>

<p>During this seven months of waiting for the Postmaster-General’s
final decision on the points raised, there were
several interesting happenings.</p>

<p>For the first time in the history of postal journalism, a
writer in the <cite>Post</cite> was called on by the department to explain
a certain paragraph to which his name was attached. The
whole thing was innocent enough and was proved so, but the
spirit that inspired the interference was thought to savour of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
official censorship, and being promptly resisted, the Permanent
Secretary, seeing the absurdity of pressing the point against
the writer, very sensibly allowed the matter to drop. This
ended as a comedy; but a rather more serious matter was the
further trespass on the right of combination on the part of
the officials in compelling Groves, the treasurer of the Fawcett
Association, to resign from his position as a paid officer of
the organisation. He had received a small appointment as
a supervisor, and he was given the alternative of resigning
his appointment as an overseer or ceasing to be a paid
officer of the organisation. Groves had been identified with
the movement from its inception, and was regarded as one
of the pillars of postal combination. He had either to resign
his position as treasurer or be reduced to the ranks. That
was the Postmaster-General’s decision. Groves put himself
in the hands of his constituents, and as it was decided that
it would be impolitic and unnecessary for him to martyr himself
he resigned his position as treasurer of the association.</p>

<p>The all-important question of civil rights for postal servants,
and the outrage on the principle of combination involved in
the dismissals of Messrs. Clery and Cheesman, was once more
brought before the attention of the House, this time by
Mr. Sam Woods, M.P., who on February 18, 1898, moved an
amendment to the address. The reinstatement question had
now come to be known as the “hardy annual” of the Post-Office.
Sir Albert Rollit ably supported the amendment.
Mr. Hanbury, as representing the Postmaster-General, replied
to the strictures on postal administration, and in dealing with
the particular matter of the dismissals and the question of
reinstatement, made some very pointed allusions to the two
dismissed officials of the sorters’ trades union, Messrs. Clery
and Cheesman. After recapitulating the facts of the dismissals,
as interpreted by the Post-Office, he went on to speak of Clery
at some length, quoting a memorable speech made by Clery
at Newcastle in 1892. He justified the dismissals, and maintained
that postal servants had nothing to complain of in the
matter of civil rights, and, while paying a high tribute to the
loyalty that distinguished the service, urged that nothing
should be done by the House to break down the foundation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
on which the service rested. The amendment was lost by a
majority of seventy-seven.</p>

<p>At length, on March 15, 1898, the long-waited-for decision
of the Postmaster-General to the various questions laid before
him as the outcome of objections to the Tweedmouth scheme
was announced. This decision on the numerous points was
nearly as disappointing as the report of the Tweedmouth
Committee itself. There were a few very minor concessions,
which affected only a few, but which were said to involve an
additional cost of £80,000 per annum; but the greater number
of the questions raised were unceremoniously dismissed in
a simple paragraph as “the various other matters which are
not mentioned in this paper.” After all the solemn pretence
of rehearing the case, and admitting evidence that seemed
well-nigh irrefutable, postal servants expected something more
satisfactory. Indignation meetings were once more held
among the various postal bodies, and disappointment and disagreement
again found vent in strongly-worded resolutions
calling on the Postmaster-General for yet another revision, on
the ground that the reply did not adequately deal with the
facts submitted, and that in the main the representations had
been ignored.</p>

<p>The expenditure of the additional sum of £80,000 on the
further concessions did not go very far when spread over such
a vast area of postal service, and it was far from satisfying.</p>

<p>The numerous representations made to the Postmaster-General
as the result of this renewal of disappointment called
forth some months afterwards, in September, what the <cite>Daily
Chronicle</cite> described as a “stern message,” to be shared equally
among the discontented. This “stern message” was conveyed
in the Postmaster-General’s annual report, issued September
1898. Dealing with the Tweedmouth Committee and
the grievances of sections of the postal staff covered by that
inquiry, and the manifold representations that had since been
made, the Postmaster-General stated that further concessions
had already been made to the amount of £50,000; and he
added, “Since that time I have declined, and I shall continue
to decline, to allow decisions which have been considered by
the Tweedmouth Committee, and which have been revised by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
Mr. Hanbury and myself, to be reopened. It is my belief that
these decisions have been liberal, but whether they are liberal
or not, it is for the interests of all parties that it should be
understood that they are final.”</p>

<p>The word “finality” was written across the decisions of the
Postmaster-General, and the postal service was given to understand
that nothing more was to be expected. This did not
tend to allay the feeling of disappointment that had taken
possession of all bodies of postal servants. There were still
more meetings, and still more protests; but to no effect so
far as the department was concerned. The conviction that
their claims had not been adequately met, however, obtained
a strong hold everywhere, and helped to still further promote
that spirit of federation which for some two or three years had
been at work among the various associations. It was not so
much the little they had gained by the Tweedmouth inquiry,
as what they had actually lost, and the parsimonious manner
in which many of the more favourable recommendations were
being applied by the authorities, and even in some cases, as
was alleged, wholly withheld.</p>

<p>The question of civil rights for postal servants and cognate
matters occupied the attention of the Trades Union Congress
at Bristol; and two resolutions were passed urging the matter
once more on the attention of the Postmaster-General. The
first of the two resolutions in question protested against the
persistent refusal of the Postmaster-General to allow the legitimate
right of combination and civil liberty to postal employés,
and strongly condemned “the repeated attempts to break up
the postal organisations by intimidating their officers.” The
second resolution protested against “the failure of the Postmaster-General
to carry into effect the recommendations of
the Tweedmouth Committee in regard to split duties (emphatically
condemned by the official medical officers as highly
injurious to health), and the insanitary condition of Post-Office
buildings, which were admitted to be in a most dangerous
condition, and a standing menace to the life and health of
the workers.” These two resolutions were forwarded by the
Parliamentary Committee, through Mr. Sam Woods, M.P., to
the Postmaster-General. The Postmaster-General, Nov. 15,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
replied to this impeachment of the Trades Union Congress;
and, admitting much of its truth, pledged himself that
“every effort was being made” in regard to the objectionable
working conditions, and at the same time repeated his assurance
that he had “no wish to curtail the privilege of combination
in the Post-Office,” but he wished it to be distinctly
understood that he was “unable to condone insubordination
in any rank of the service, merely because it is disguised
under the cloak of civil liberty.” The reply of the Postmaster-General
was regarded with some slight satisfaction by
postal servants, though it was not accepted as covering all
the facts alleged.</p>

<p>The long-standing hostility of one of the higher officials
towards the principle of combination again manifested itself
in an unexpected manner not long afterwards. In the following
month of December some severe animadversions on postal
servants and postal combination from Mr. Lewin Hill, the
lately-retired Assistant Secretary, reported in the <cite>Daily
Graphic</cite>, provoked strong resentment generally, which, however,
gradually subsided in amusement on the attacks becoming
several times repeated, and as often replied to in other
organs of the press.</p>

<p>In the prosecution of Parliamentary policy the postal movement
had gained strong reinforcements, both in the service
and in the House of Commons. Members of Parliament had
come and gone, but the number of their advocates had not
fallen away. Among the new adherents to their cause was
Mr. W. C. Steadman, M.P., whose return for Stepney had
been secured by the turning balance of the postal vote there.
Among all the members of the House who had beaten their
brains against the granite walls of St. Martin’s-le-Grand,
Mr. Steadman from the first moment of his election proved
the most persistent and the most pushful in his advocacy of
postal claims. On the opening of the February session, 1899,
he moved an amendment to the Address, and once more
recapitulated the sins of omission and commission for which
the Tweedmouth Inquiry was responsible, and strenuously
urged for a Parliamentary Committee of Inquiry to complete
the work left undone, being ably supported by other friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
of the postal cause. Mr. Hanbury, as representing the Postmaster-General,
resisted further inquiry by the adoption of the
official arguments which had served their purpose so well on
former occasions. As strengthening his argument, the Postmaster-General’s
representative took the opportunity of importing
into the discussion a personal attack on W. E. Clery,
who had, since his dismissal for furthering the right of combination,
become notorious as the arch agitator of the postal
movement. Mr. Hanbury made the damaging assertion that
“the battle rages round Mr. Clery, the man who is responsible
for the agitation.” Yet very illogically, as it seems, he tried
to prove that the agitator round whom this battle was raging
had not the confidence of trades unionists, inasmuch, as he
averred, he was refused admission to the Trades Union
Congress, “because he was neither a working member of the
trade he represented nor a paid permanent official.” It was
an absurd misstatement, as the chairman of the Sorters’ Association
had never been refused admission at any Trades Union
Congress, but had represented his society there for several
successive years. If he was not literally and actually a working
member of the craft he represented, he was so in the
meaning of the Congress rules, and in any case it was a weak
and unworthy argument. In conclusion, the Postmaster-General’s
advocate, in paying an unintentional tribute to the
postal agitator by allowing that Clery was the pivot on which
the whole agitation turned, and that but for him there would
be no organised discontent, used an argument which was most
calculated to strengthen the hands of the agitator whom it was
desired to efface. This speech for the defence on the part of
Mr. Hanbury on this occasion was also rendered a cause for
remembrance to the telegraphists, whose work he contemptuously
described as only “superior type-writing.” The insult
thus levelled at the telegraphists was pointed with a comparison
with the sorters’ duties, which were described as requiring
“more skill than telegraphic work.”</p>

<p>But neither the attack on Clery in the House of Commons
nor the compliment to postal work at the expense of the
telegraphists availed beyond the momentary triumph. The
interests of postal servants were wedded and welded in a new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
comradeship, which neither insult nor flattery were likely to
dissolve. The best answer to these strictures was the successful
institution of postal federation throughout the service.
The federation of postal associations was already an accomplished
fact, and at last telegraphists, postmen, sorting clerks,
sorters, and nearly all classes were united in one homogeneous
whole for the furtherance of common interests. There had
been several tentative attempts at this in the years gone by,
but misunderstandings had forbidden its culmination till now.
One result of the universal disappointment following on the
Tweedmouth Inquiry and the Norfolk-Hanbury Conference
was the burying by mutual consent of all class feeling, and the
cementing of classes and sections which till now never fully
realised that they had so much in common to strive for. The
aim of the federated associations was to be at once simple and
comprehensive. Unitedly they were to set about it as their
first and primary duty to obtain an unofficial, impartial, and
disinterested, yet authoritative, Committee of Inquiry into the
remaining grievances of postal servants. This they apprehended
would comprehend, if not all things, yet most. The
vindication of full rights of combination, which could never
bring its logical benefit to the men or to the department until
it was coupled with official recognition, was another important
matter which was to be accepted as a foremost plank in their
platform. Of equal importance to every postal servant, whatever
his grade, was the claim to full recognition of the liberty of
the individual in his leisure time, and the abolition of paltry
and unnecessary restrictions on a postal servant’s freedom to
engage in any enterprise or undertaking of an honourable
nature, according to his fitness or desire to better his prospects
outside the service. Related to and closely following on this
was to be the claim for citizen rights and all that it involved,
including the reinstatement of the unjustly-dismissed officials
of the Fawcett Association. They were to insist on more
humane treatment as servants of the State, and all those better
conditions of hours and work which even the Tweedmouth
scheme had left them unprovided with. A better minimum
wage for the juniors, the question of deferred pay and pensions,
promotion, favouritism, harsh medical restrictions, and numerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
other matters were to be included in the programme
which should facilitate their hopeful journeyings in search
of the postal land of promise and a contented service flowing
with milk and honey. The general adoption of this programme
by the combined associations at the first Congress,
held at Derby, September 1899, marked an epoch in postal
history. It was a fitting celebration of the jubilee of postal
agitation. Now, with the purpose of achieving these ideals
by the way, they steadfastly set their faces towards the time-point
when the State should in very truth become the model
employer and the great exemplar to the labour market of the
world.</p>

<p class="tb">Such concisely supplies, so far as it has gone, the history of
a remarkable agitation. Whatever its lesson, and whatever
the ultimate verdict upon it from a strictly impartial standpoint,
postal agitation is a fact that bears recording in the
general history of organised labour. Whether it may be deemed
wholly justified or not, it has its value as an episode.</p>

<p>Agitation in the Post-Office may not always have been
studiously correct in attitude and demeanour, but perhaps it
has committed no more and no greater mistakes than have the
officials in their dealings with it in the past. It might almost
be said that it represents, if only in miniature, the people’s
fight for freedom and the gradual extension of popular liberty;
for the Post-Office has seen its pre-Chartist days, when to dare
openly organise discontent would have been to make men
amenable to the Law of Conspiracy. It has represented a continuous
conflict between the spirit of exaction on one side,
and the natural desire for betterment in pay and conditions, in
just accordance with the improving value of labour everywhere,
on the other. It has, indeed, been but a reflection and an
analogue of the earlier struggles between capital and labour
outside, and generally a protest against that fixed and fossilised
scale of pay and that Procrustean standard of conditions for
all time which have been shown to be no more possible here
than in the broader arena of the labour market. Right or
wrong, but always sustained by the conviction of right nevertheless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
with the self-same tenacity with which their efforts
have been repelled, the men who have from time to time
engaged in this movement have persisted till they have beaten
down the barriers, and gained some proportion of those
advantages they laid claim to as their just dues.</p>

<p>Perhaps in a manner it may be accepted as a faint tribute
to our Constitution and a self-compliment to our freedom-asserting
and freedom-loving character as a people to say that
only in England could a history of postal agitation have been
possible. It is in itself a small consequence, perhaps, but it
is significant as a consequence and an outcome of that free,
powerful, and independent public opinion which safeguards and
promotes our liberties; it is only one of the natural results of
that dominating spirit of democracy which has so broadened
our boundaries morally and materially as a nation.</p>

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
